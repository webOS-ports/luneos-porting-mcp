# Device: titanpocket (Unihertz Titan Pocket, MediaTek MT6771)

Unihertz Titan Pocket (`titanpocket`), MediaTek MT6771 (Helio P70), Tier B on its Android 11 vendor: boots to the UI with a source-built kernel; subsystems in bring-up.

The first kernel ever booted from its source tree: Unihertz publish no kernel source, and the Ubuntu Touch port for this phone still packs the stock prebuilt kernel. The tree is TheKit's reverse-engineered MediaTek ALPS 4.14. It is also the device that showed Tier B has an ABI to keep: a force-loaded stock Wi-Fi module panicked a kernel whose config had moved a struct (kmi-crc-matching.md § Struct layouts).

## Kernel

`linux-unihertz-titanpocket` (meta-unihertz, shared body in `linux-unihertz-alps-a11.inc` /
`linux-unihertz-mt6771.inc`): github.com/shr-distribution/linux branch
`unihertz-mt6771/4.14/halium-11.0`, SRCREV `8d83bc9a`, `KV = "4.14.186"`. The base is TheKit's
`halium-11.0` branch of github.com/ubuntu-touch-unihertz-titan/kernel-alps-mt6771 at
`ba3ad72c6c2d` (an AOSP `android-4.14-stable` tree plus one squashed ALPS drop from another
MT6771 OEM, with the device drivers recovered from the stock binary). The Titan Slim shares the
tree, the branch and the dtb; only the defconfig differs (`titanpocket_defconfig`, regenerated
from the phone's `/proc/config.gz`). Built with OE's GCC (15.3.0) instead of the clang r383902
the tree was written against.

LuneOS commits on the branch:

| Patch | Kind |
|---|---|
| 0001 demote 35 benign newer-GCC warning classes | plumbing: 80 Makefiles carry a bare `-Werror`; `strict-prototypes`, `pointer-to-int-cast`, `int-conversion`, `implicit-*`, `return-type` stay errors |
| 0002 drop bogus `inline` on `ksm_flock`/`blk_crypto_flock` | real bug: exported and called across translation units while declared `inline` (= `always_inline`) |
| 0003 remove the duplicate `set_selection` | real bug, exposed by `CONFIG_VT=y` (the Unihertz defconfigs disable VT); kept the copy that takes `sel_lock` |
| 0004 `lcm_init()` → `lcm_init(void)` | real bug in the panel driver |
| 0005 dpmaif pointer casts through `uintptr_t` | real bug: 64-bit pointers narrowed to `u32` in trace lines |
| 0006 eight K&R definitions given `(void)` | real bugs |
| 0007 `cmdq_pkt_get_curr_buf_va` returns `NULL`, not `-ENOMEM` | real bug: a `void *` function returning `-ENOMEM` |
| later | CP2166 backlight inversion; Sunwave fingerprint driver v2.2.38 (from Teracube; `CONFIG_SUNWAVE_FP=y`) with sensor detection enabled for TrustKernel phones as stock has it; ov16880 (from TheKit's Titan branch) and ov8865 (from Teracube) with the ov16880 EEPROM entry and the rear camera's AVDD on its GPIO-switched regulator as stock; the Pocket's own AW9523 key matrix (read from the stock kernel) and Fn as Ctrl |

Config: `luneos.cfg` (the standard delta, kernel-config.md § The config delta) plus
`CONFIG_FRAME_WARN=4096` (GCC gives `mtk_battery_core.c` a 2144-byte frame) and
`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO` off. `titanpocket_defconfig` names `ov16880_mipi_raw` and `ov8865_mipi_raw`,
which the base tree did not contain (it ships only `gc02m0`, `gc2375h`, `gc5035`); patch 0010
adds them and `titanpocket-imgsensor.cfg` lists them.

**Vendor modules.** The stock connectivity modules (`wmt_drv`, `wlan_drv_gen3`, `bt_drv`,
`gps_drv`, `fmradio_drv`) are force-loaded by the Android container
(`CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_LOAD=y`, taint `FO`), so every option that changes a struct they use
must match stock. Kept at stock, with the measurement in kmi-crc-matching.md § Struct layouts
(config diff and the `kheaders.ko` layout probe, 1439 structs compared):

| Option | Struct | State |
|---|---|---|
| NETCONSOLE → NETPOLL, NET_POLL_CONTROLLER | `net_device`, `net_device_ops` | off |
| CGROUP_NET_PRIO | `net_device` (`priomap`) | off |
| BLK_CGROUP (→ CGROUP_WRITEBACK with MEMCG) | `inode` | off |
| CGROUP_PERF | `perf_event`, `perf_cpu_context` (used by `met.ko`) | off |

FANOTIFY (`user_struct` tail padding) and CGROUP_DEVICE (cgroup-core internals) stay on: the
probe shows those changes harmless here. All `mtk_wcn_*` imports resolve to `wmt_drv.ko`.
MODVERSIONS CRCs are useless as a check on this reconstructed tree (15–90 mismatches per
module, `printk` included).

### Rejected paths

- **NETCONSOLE as a debug channel.** It was in the first `luneos.cfg`; 22 s into every boot
  the container's force-load of `wlan_drv_gen3` panicked:

  ```
  mtk_wmtd_worker: Unable to handle kernel paging request at 0055aa8d704b2800
  pc : 0x55aa8d704b2800   lr : __dev_xdp_attached+0x48/0xa0
   rtnl_fill_ifinfo <- rtmsg_ifinfo <- register_netdevice <- register_netdev
   <- [wlan_drv_gen3] <- wmt_lib_init [wmt_drv]
  ```

  NET_POLL_CONTROLLER inserts three `ndo_*` pointers into `struct net_device_ops`, so the
  stock-laid-out ops table was read at the wrong offsets (kmi-crc-matching.md § NETCONSOLE
  and NET_POLL_CONTROLLER).
- **Instrumenting the initramfs to find that panic.** Five flash rounds showed nothing,
  because the panic came after switch_root. Reading ramoops out of DRAM found it in one read
  (Device-specific traps).

## Boot image

Header v2, MediaTek style, built by `kernel_android.bbclass`. Shipped image, verified against
stock:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| header version / page size | 2 / 2048 |
| kernel | 10,424,310 B @ `0x40080000`, gzip `Image.gz` |
| ramdisk | 6,650,204 B @ `0x55000000` |
| second | none, address `0x40f00000` |
| tags / dtb | `0x54000000` |
| dtb | 114,158 B, AOSP dt_table (`d7b7ab1e`, one entry of 114,094 B), md5 `1c0ec5e5c084e9bbb559ea99651a2e56` — byte-identical to stock, and to the Titan Slim's |
| os_version | ours 11.0.0 / 2022-03 (`0x16000163`); the 2024-05-14 stock boot.img carries 2022-09 (`0x16000169`); lk boots ours |
| cmdline | `bootopt=64S3,32N2,64N2 buildvariant=user log_buf_len=4M printk.devkmsg=on` |
| total | 17,192,960 B payload, then an unsigned AVB hash footer, padded to the 32 MiB partition |

- **Gzip is required in practice**: UBports' packer prefers `Image.gz`, and the UT adaptation
  gzips the stock kernel before packing, so that is what this lk has always been handed.
- **lk passes the header cmdline through**: `log_buf_len=4M` and `printk.devkmsg=on` arrive in
  `/proc/cmdline` (5 Oct log). No 20-character drop as on the G99.
- **AVB**: the MediaTek chain (soc-mediatek.md § Boot chain), signed with Unihertz's key. The
  kit flashes the stock vbmeta with flags 3; lk logs `HASH_MISMATCH`, `img_auth_required = 0`,
  orange state, and boots ours. The unsigned footer
  (`ANDROID_BOOTIMG_AVB_PARTITION_SIZE = "33554432"`, meta-android `lib/halium/avb.py`,
  byte-identical to `avbtool add_hash_footer`) matches stock's and UBports' shape.
- Not carried from the UBports cmdline: `security=apparmor`, `rodata=0` (only for inserting
  modules into the stock kernel), `init=/init`.

## Vendor and GSI

Stock Android 11 vendor (VNDK 30) → the generic Halium 16 GSI
(`halium-luneos-16.0-20260910-1-halium_arm64` when first brought up; every machine now
takes the release pinned in meta-android's `halium-luneos-gsi-16.inc`); it carries `com.android.vndk.v30`, so no VNDK work was needed. Composer is HIDL
(`android.hardware.graphics.composer@2.1-service`). The phone keeps its own `vendor`, `super`,
`dtbo`, modem and firmware.

## Yocto

Layer `meta-unihertz` (Titan, Titan Pocket and Titan Slim; shared `unihertz-mt6771.inc`),
`MACHINE=titanpocket`. The machine builds only the boot image; the rootfs is the generic
`halium-arm64` one and the GSI travels beside it.

```
MACHINE=titanpocket bitbake initramfs-android-image
MACHINE=titanpocket bitbake linux-unihertz-titanpocket     # boot.img (kernel + initramfs)
```

Machine facts: `KERNEL_IMAGETYPE = "Image.gz"`, `SERIAL_CONSOLE = "921600 ttyMT0"` (no
debug UART is reachable without opening the phone), boot partition by-name under
`/dev/block/platform/bootdevice/by-name/`. `MACHINE_FEATURES` includes `keyboard-qwerty`,
`nfc`, `fingerprint` and no camera feature yet, although the kernel now builds both sensors.
Device adaptation: `luneos-device-config` `adaptations/Titan_pocket/sparse/etc/libncicore.conf`
(Tier 2).

## Install

Fastboot (bootloader must be unlocked). Kit: `boot-titanpocket-luneos.img`,
`boot-titanpocket-luneos-debug.img` (`enable_adb`), `boot-titanpocket-luneos-faillog.img`
(`initrd_log_fail initrd_log_part=cache`), `vbmeta-disabled.img` (stock vbmeta, flags 3),
`userdata-luneos.img` (5.0 GB ext4: `rootfs.img` + `android-rootfs.img`, grows on first boot),
`vbmeta-stock.img` and `boot-stock.img` for reverting, `dump-expdb.sh`, `make-userdata.sh`.

- `install.sh [--debug|--faillog]` checks `fastboot getvar product` and `unlocked`, then
  flashes vbmeta → boot → userdata (wiped) → reboot.
- `flash-boot.sh --normal|--debug` (default: faillog) updates vbmeta + boot only, keeping
  userdata.
- No `fastboot boot` (soc-mediatek.md § Boot chain: preloader and lk), so the debug image is flashed.
- Revert: `fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta-stock.img`, `fastboot flash boot boot-stock.img`,
  `fastboot -w` (both from the 2024-05-14 ROM; an older firmware should use its own). If the
  phone does not enumerate, SP Flash Tool or mtkclient over the preloader: write `vbmeta`,
  `boot` and `userdata` only, never `preloader` (soc-mediatek.md § Install over BROM/preloader).

## Subsystem notes

### `/cache` and the first bootloop

The first hardware boot started the container, which then died in `fs_mgr` (`mke2fs returned
256`, `failed to format cache`) and rebooted in a loop. The initramfs bind-mounted `/cache`
from userdata only when the mountpoint did not exist, and a GSI ships `/cache` as a real empty
directory (inode 17, mode 0770, `system:cache`), so the container's init tried to mount the
phone's own cache partition. Fixed in `initramfs-scripts-halium` patch 0004 (the `/proc/mounts`
test UBports carry in their Pocket/Slim adaptation); `dmesg | grep -i cache` shows
`bound /userdata/cache to /android/cache`.

### NFC

nfcd registers `nfc0`, but every `RF_DISCOVER` was answered `STATUS_REJECTED` ("[nci]
WARNING! > RF_DISCOVER_RSP error 1"): the ST21NFC refuses NFC-F. The Tier 2
`libncicore.conf` restricts polling to `Poll-A, Poll-B` (mer-hybris/nfcd-pn54x-plugin#5,
mer-hybris/libncicore#21); FeliCa cards will not read.

### Fingerprint

The Sunwave driver found the sensor once TrustKernel-phone detection was enabled; biomd then
asked 2 s after start, while the vendor service was still setting up its secure session, and
gave up for the boot. biomd now waits up to 30 s.

## Open issues

- Audio: `module-droid-card` fails to initialise.
- Camera capture, fingerprint enrol, NFC tag reads, GPS: untested.
- Wi-Fi: one report of a rejected handshake against a log that shows a completed one.
- Keyboard punctuation unverified: Qt reads only `EV_KEY`, never `MSC_SCAN` (as on q25), so
  audit what the driver reports.
- `MACHINE_FEATURES` lacks `camera-rear`/`camera-front`.
- Expect the display scaling (grid unit, device pixel ratio) to need tuning by eye in the
  Tier 1 adaptation, as q25's 720x720 did.

## Device-specific traps

**Debugging a bootloop.** Nothing enumerates on USB when it bootloops, there is no pstore
console to read afterwards, and expdb's kedump region came back as zeros (twice) while lk's
own log showed `lk boot reason = 4` (`kernel_panic`, `exp_type 0x2`). What worked (method:
soc-mediatek.md § Read ramoops straight out of DRAM over the preloader):

- `mtk da peek 0x54410000 0xe0000 --filename pstore.bin`, catching the preloader **while it
  bootloops** (holding Power or the Volume-Down BROM route from power-off loses DRAM). The
  console zone was at +0x4f000, pmsg at +0xd0000; the other ~80 4 KiB zones were empty
  dmesg-dump slots. pmsg showed the container up and surface-manager loading the vendor
  hwcomposer, so the rest of the port was healthy.
- `dump-expdb.sh` reads DRAM first, then `mtk r expdb,cache` in the same session, and decodes
  lk's `[AVB]` lines, the boot-image load, kernel panics, initramfs and `fs_mgr`.
- The faillog image logs to `cache` (debugging.md § Recording the initramfs to a spare
  partition). The first faillog `cache.bin` came back as untouched ext4: its logger started
  only after module load. With `initrd_log_part=` it starts right after `/proc`, `/sys` and
  devtmpfs. The empty record was itself the clue: the panic came after switch_root.
