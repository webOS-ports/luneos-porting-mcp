# Kernel Porting for LuneOS (GKI Tier A and Legacy Tier B)

The LuneOS kernel-porting method: one GKI kernel per KMI on Tier A devices, a per-device vendor BSP kernel on Tier B, and how to verify both before flashing.

On GKI devices (Android 12+, kernel ≥5.10) you build **one kernel per KMI, not per
device** — the stock vendor modules keep loading because the KMI is binary-stable —
while pre-GKI devices need a per-device kernel built from the vendor BSP source
(Tier B). Both tiers hinge on the same three steps: extract the stock config,
compute the LuneOS delta with `mer_verify_kernel_config`, and verify host-side,
*before* flashing anything, that the vendor's modules will still load.

Everything about whether a vendor `.ko` loads into your kernel — vermagic, CRCs,
poison options, struct layouts, force-loading, and building and shipping your own
modules instead — is in kmi-crc-matching.md. Tool usage is in tools.md.

---

## The config delta (both tiers)

Extract the stock config from the stock kernel (`IKCONFIG`; Android kernels carry
it — kmi-crc-matching.md § Step 1 has the extraction), then run
`mer_verify_kernel_config` (tools.md § mer-kernel-check) on it to size the delta,
and again on your shipped config to confirm every remaining error is deliberate.
Interpret errors as "explain or fix", not "fix". Measured: stock GKI 6.1 (bluejay)
23 errors / 59 warnings — **`gki_defconfig` alone is NOT enough**, but the fragment
is small and known; mindphone's stock 4.14 13 / 58; the shipped bluejay config 5
errors, all accounted for (SYSVIPC, not needed; NET_L3_MASTER_DEV, KMI-poison;
NF_LOG_IPV4/6 and DUMMY, checker quirks listed in tools.md).

**Missing hard requirements** (systemd/LuneOS) in stock GKI:

- `DEVTMPFS` (+ `DEVTMPFS_MOUNT`)
- `FHANDLE`
- `TMPFS_POSIX_ACL`, `TMPFS_XATTR`
- `VT`
- netfilter/PPP/L2TP error items: `NF_LOG_IPV4/6`, `IP_NF_MATCH_RPFILTER`,
  `INET_AH`/`INET6_AH`, `INET_IPCOMP`, `PPP_*`, `L2TP_*`, `NET_L3_MASTER_DEV`,
  `DUMMY`, `QUOTA_NETLINK_INTERFACE`, `STATIC_USERMODEHELPER` off
- `UEVENT_HELPER=y` + `UEVENT_HELPER_PATH=""`: the initramfs's mdev writes
  `/sys/kernel/uevent_helper`, which stock GKI does not provide; without it late
  hotplug events are lost (the initial `mdev -s` covers the normal path, but add
  it if by-partlabel links come up empty). Behavioural and KMI-safe.
- `# CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_PROTECT is not set` on a rebuilt GKI, or the stock vendor
  modules never load although every CRC matches (kmi-crc-matching.md § A failure
  class invisible to CRC checks)
- Also off in stock: `USER_NS`, `PID_NS`, `AUTOFS_FS`, `SQUASHFS`, `CHECKPOINT_RESTORE`

**Not required:** `SYSVIPC` (and with it `IPC_NS`). LuneOS does not use SysV IPC;
leave `# CONFIG_SYSVIPC is not set`.

**Already good in stock GKI**: `NAMESPACES`, `NET_NS`, `UTS_NS`, `CGROUPS`
(+freezer, memcg, v2), `EXT4`, `F2FS`, `OVERLAY_FS`, `VETH`, `BRIDGE`, `TUN`,
`BLK_DEV_LOOP`, `BLK_DEV_DM`, binder+binderfs, `FUSE`, `SECCOMP`, `IKCONFIG_PROC`.

**On a Tier A kernel some of the delta is KMI-poison** and must stay off. On
`android14-6.1` (bluejay, panther) that is `FANOTIFY` and `NET_L3_MASTER_DEV`;
everything else above is KMI-clean (zero CRC drift). The list is per KMI and
kernel tree — re-derive it, never transplant it (kmi-crc-matching.md § Poison
options). Userland consequences of the android14-6.1 list:

- No fanotify (systemd is fine without it).
- No VRF/l3mdev (ofono is fine).

Independently of any poison list, **LXC must not unshare the IPC namespace**:
`SYSVIPC` is off, so `IPC_NS` is too. Nor the user namespace where `USER_NS` is off
(stock GKI, Q25). `PID_NS` is available. The shipped config carries
`lxc.namespace.keep = ipc user`.

### Fragment traps

- **Check the merged `.config`, not the fragment.** `merge_config.sh` drops a
  symbol that is not in Kconfig **silently**, with no warning in
  `log.do_configure`. `CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_BOOTPARAM_VALUE=0` is standard advice
  for Android kernels and does nothing on CIP 4.19.325: that tree backported the
  5.x SELinux/LSM rework (visible in the built `.config` as `CONFIG_LSM="…"`,
  `CONFIG_SECURITY_SELINUX_SIDTAB_HASH_BITS`, `CONFIG_SECURITY_LOCKDOWN_LSM` on a
  4.19 kernel), which **deleted the symbol** in favour of
  `int selinux_enabled_boot __initdata = 1;` plus `__setup("selinux=", …)`. A
  long-term stable tree (CIP, Android LTS) can have newer infrastructure than its
  version number suggests; grep the Kconfig in the actual source before trusting a
  symbol name.
- **Never start a comment line in a fragment with `# CONFIG_`.**
  `merge_config.sh` matches `^(# )?CONFIG_[A-Za-z0-9_][= ]`, so
  `# CONFIG_DUMMY=y  kept at the stock value` is parsed as a directive and
  silently unsets the symbol (found on athena; see device-athena.md).
- **Kleaf folds comment lines into the expected value.** Kleaf verifies a
  defconfig fragment by grepping it for the symbol token, so a fragment must not
  mention, even in a comment, a symbol it declares (cost one bluejay build).

## Tier A — GKI devices (Android 12+, kernel ≥5.10)

### Step 1: Check that the stock kernel really is GKI

A GKI boot image and `android12-5.10` in the version string do not imply that an
ACK build will do. MediaTek ships its *mgk* derivative on MT6789: an ACK kernel
failed 344 of 344 stock modules on the Q25, `module_layout` included, and the
port builds the device's own tree instead (found on the Q25; see device-q25.md).
Run `kmi-crc-check.py` against a first ACK build before assuming the
one-kernel-per-KMI property holds.

### Step 2: The KMI/MODVERSIONS constraint

GKI kernels build with `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y` (`MODULE_SIG_FORCE` is **not** set on
bluejay). Config options that add fields to core structs (e.g.
`CONFIG_NET_L3_MASTER_DEV` adds `l3mdev_ops` to `struct net_device`) change the
genksyms CRCs of exported symbols. The stock vendor modules (vendor_boot dlkm
fragment + `vendor_dlkm`, or on A13-launch devices `vendor_kernel_boot` +
`vendor_dlkm`) then **refuse to load** against your rebuilt kernel — and losing
them loses the whole Tier A property.

### Step 3: Verify host-side, before any flash

1. Extract the stock vendor modules from the factory image
   (`extract-vendor-modules.sh`, tools.md; it reads both the `vendor_boot` dlkm
   fragment and `vendor_kernel_boot.img`).
2. Build ACK with your fragment (kernel-only target, Step 4).
3. Run `kmi-crc-check.py <Module.symvers> <dir of stock .kos>` (tools.md).
   Target: **0 modules would fail to load**.
4. If modules fail, bisect the fragment one option at a time with
   `symvers-drift.py` (kmi-crc-matching.md § Poison options has the method and the
   three-minute per-object harness). On bluejay the full fragment drifted 3145
   exported-symbol CRCs and failed 203/203 modules; with `FANOTIFY` and
   `NET_L3_MASTER_DEV` out, drift was 0.

### Step 4: Build ACK

Two routes produce the same kernel:

- **Yocto** (what LuneOS ships):
  `meta-android/recipes-kernel/linux-halium-gki/linux-halium-gki_6.1.bb` builds
  ACK android14-6.1 with the LuneOS fragment using Google's prebuilt clang 17
  (**r487747c**, the clang the KMI was frozen with) and plain kbuild — no Bazel,
  and **not** OE's cross toolchain, which has never been validated against this
  KMI; a silent CRC drift would only show up on the device as vendor modules that
  do not load. `luneos-bootimg-gki` (with `meta-android/classes/gki_bootimg.bbclass`)
  consumes it by default via `GKI_KERNEL_PROVIDER ?= "linux-halium-gki"`; setting
  `GKI_KERNEL_IMAGE` overrides that with an out-of-tree Image, which
  `do_deploy[file-checksums]` hashes so a new kernel really does rebuild the boot
  images instead of returning stale sstate. Machines opt in with
  `GKI_BOOTIMG = "1"` in their own machine conf; `GKI_KERNEL_IMAGE_NAME` asks for
  `Image.gz` instead of `Image.lz4`; `GKI_CLANG_DIR` / `GKI_BUILD_TOOLS_DIR` are
  machine-scoped in local.conf because a 5.10 kernel wants clang **r416183b**
  while android14-6.1 wants **r487747c**. bluejay/panther set
  `PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-halium-gki = "6.1%"`;
  `PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-dummy"` only means the rootfs
  carries no kernel.
- **Kleaf** (Pixel kernel manifests, `repo init -u
  https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/manifest -b
  android-gs-<device>-6.1-android16`, about 10 GB). Prebuilt GKI is the default;
  `--config=use_source_tree_aosp` builds `//aosp` from source, which any config
  change needs. Put the fragment in a package with a `BUILD.bazel` filegroup and
  build the kernel alone:

  ```
  tools/bazel build --config=use_source_tree_aosp \
    --//build/kernel/kleaf:defconfig_fragment=//luneos:luneos_defconfig \
    //aosp:kernel_aarch64
  ```

### 5.10 kbuild gotchas

A 5.10 tree built with clang has traps a 6.1 one does not; expect them on any 5.10
port, each costs a build cycle (found on the Q25; see device-q25.md):

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `register 'sp' unsuitable for global register variables on this target` in `asm-offsets.c` | 5.10 derives clang's `--target` from `CROSS_COMPILE`; `LLVM=1` alone does not imply one (6.1 works it out from `ARCH`), so clang built for the x86_64 host | `CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-` — only the triple is used |
| wants an external assembler | 5.10 defaults to `-fno-integrated-as` | `LLVM_IAS=1` |
| `link-vmlinux.sh: python: not found` after a full compile | 5.10 spells `PYTHON` as `python` and calls `scripts/jobserver-exec` | `PYTHON=python3` (Droidian's CI symlinks `python`→`python2`, host-wide and the wrong interpreter) |

Plus `CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT=arm-linux-gnueabi-` wherever `CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO=y`.

### Vendor-hook modules and the ACK tag

Factory vendor modules can be built against a **newer** ACK tag than the kernel
manifest pins, and Google ships kernel and modules decoupled. Modules that import
vendor-hook tracepoints (`android_rvh_*`, `android_vh_*`, `android_trigger_*`)
then fail against a build from the pinned checkout. Fix: check out an
`android14-6.1-<yyyy>-<mm>_r<n>` release tag new enough to carry them
(add-only KMI growth, no CRC drift). A later `repo sync` reverts the checkout,
and the manifest-pinned vendor-module sources may no longer compile against the
bumped headers — irrelevant for Tier A, where the stock modules are the point
(found on bluejay: `vh_mm.ko`/`vh_sched.ko`; see device-bluejay.md).

### One kernel per KMI

Panther's stock kernel is byte-identical to bluejay's (device-panther.md): one GKI
per KMI, shipped identically on gs101 and gs201. A LuneOS Tier A kernel built for
one device of a KMI is a drop-in for the others — re-run `kmi-crc-check.py`
against the new device's own `.ko` set to confirm.

### Option B escape hatch (own vendor modules)

Pixel kernels are fully open source including all vendor modules, so a full
rebuild (kernel + modules + repacked vendor_boot/vendor_dlkm) is available if KMI
preservation ever fails. Build it at the **manifest-matched** state, where the full
dist succeeds. It loses the "one kernel per KMI" property but keeps a port moving,
and it ignores the poison list entirely (kmi-crc-matching.md § Step −1).

Before flashing anything on a Pixel, check anti-rollback: installing.md §
Anti-rollback.

### The vendor_dlkm module set is never loaded on Halium

A GKI-era vendor ships kernel modules in **two** sets, and Halium only ever loads
the first:

| Set | Lives in | Loaded by | On Halium |
|---|---|---|---|
| vendor_boot ramdisk | `/lib/modules` in the vendor_boot ramdisk | the initramfs, early, to reach storage | **yes** |
| `vendor_dlkm` | the `vendor_dlkm` logical partition | Android's init, later | **no** |

Halium curtails the container's init on a `wait_for_prop` gate long before it
reaches the second set, and the initramfs cannot load it either (it is a logical
partition inside `super`, needing dm-linear that the initramfs has no tooling
for). On the MP01 that is **164 modules — more than the 159 the initramfs loads.**

The symptoms do not look like "missing kernel modules":

- `nvmem-mt635x-efuse.ko` lives in `vendor_dlkm`, while `mt635x-auxadc.ko` is in
  the early set and depends on it. The auxadc probe returns **-517**
  (`EPROBE_DEFER`) forever, the fuel gauge never comes up, and healthd reports
  `battery l=-1`. lk then paints a **battery icon with a question mark**, decides
  the device is in charger mode, starts Android's `charger` binary, and reboots
  in a loop. This reads exactly like a flat battery and is not one — the same
  device reported `v=4429` (4.43 V, essentially full) while showing it.
- The **touchscreen** drivers (`gt9886.ko`, `gt9896s.ko`, `focaltech_touch.ko`)
  are in `vendor_dlkm` too, so the panel has no touch at all, nothing advertises
  `ID_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN`, and `luneos-device-config` leaves the compositor
  pointed at `evdevtouch:/dev/input/PLACEHOLDER`.

**Check for it on any new Tier A port, before blaming anything else:**

```
# how big is the set nobody loads?
wc -l < <vendor-modules>/dlkm/modules/modules.load
# is a driver you are missing in it rather than in the early set?
grep -iE 'touch|efuse|nvmem' <vendor-modules>/dlkm/modules/modules.load
# on the device
dmesg | grep -- -517
```

**Fix:** load them from `mount-android.sh`, after `vendor_dlkm` is mounted and
before the container's init starts (meta-android, `load_vendor_dlkm_modules`).
It looks for `modules.load` under each mount point the partition can land on
(`/vendor_dlkm`, `$ANDROID_ROOT/vendor_dlkm`) and is a no-op on devices without
it. `modules.load` is a **list, not a dependency order** — the same trap as in
the initramfs — so make repeated passes and stop when a pass loads nothing new.

**Who is affected:** any Android 12+ / GKI device with a `vendor_dlkm`
partition — MP01, where it was found; bluejay's factory image has one too, and
panther has not been flashed yet. **Not** affected: pre-dynamic-partition
devices, which have only one module set (mindphone: MT6739, Android 11, 4.14, no
super/vendor_boot; sargo).

---

## Tier B — legacy devices (pre-GKI, vendor BSP kernel)

### Identify the platform precisely first

Read it off the stock boot.img before writing a machine conf: kernel architecture
(a 64-bit SoC can run a **32-bit kernel + 32-bit userland**, as mindphone does
with `bootopt=64S3,32S1,32S1`), image type (`zImage` vs `Image.gz(-dtb)`), the
compiler in the version string, the serial console, and the tune. Get
TARGET_ARCH, the image type, the console and the tune right first (found on
mindphone, set up arm64 and wrong on every count; see device-mindphone.md).

### Find the stock defconfig via IKCONFIG

Stock IKCONFIG usually names the BSP project, and with it the defconfig in the
vendor GPL drop (mindphone: `k39tv1_bsp_1g` → `k39tv1_bsp_1g_defconfig`). Put the
LuneOS delta in a `file://luneos.cfg` fragment next to the recipe. When the drop
does not name its defconfig, `ARCH=<arch> make savedefconfig` (UBports docs)
minimises a full extracted config back into one.

### Old BSP vs modern toolchain: expect a patch series

A 4.14 MTK BSP took six rounds of layer patches with gcc 14 / binutils 2.4x
(device-mindphone.md has the series). The classes recur on any old tree:
obsolete asm syntax (`#alloc` section flags, upstream 790756c7e022), format
widths against 32-bit `phys_addr_t`, `-Werror` in vendor Makefiles, objects
commented out of a Makefile that the link still needs, and
`CONFIG_FRAME_WARN=2048`.

`unifdef.c` declares `static bool constexpr;`, and `constexpr` is a keyword in
C23, which modern host GCC defaults to (`-std=gnu23`). It recurs on every old
tree (mindphone 4.14, sargo 4.9): pin the host C standard or rename it.

Before a long patch series, **match the toolchain to the Android generation**
(Droidian docs): Droidian packages clang for Android 6.0/9.0/10.0/12.0/14.0 with a
gcc-4.9 fallback, and its rule of thumb is that 4.4+ kernels should compile with
clang. An era-matched compiler sidesteps most of the -Werror/new-keyword breakage
a modern host toolchain provokes. On Qualcomm trees, build with the toolchain
family the tree's own `build.config.common` names: GCC miscompiles the
register-pinned SCM call (kmi-crc-matching.md § Step 4).

### The appended-DTB glob trap (CAF arm64 trees)

`CONFIG_BUILD_ARM64_APPENDED_DTB_IMAGE_NAMES` exists so a product can append only
the device trees it needs. In a correct tree `arch/arm64/boot/Makefile` honours it:

```make
DTB_NAMES := $(subst $\",,$(CONFIG_BUILD_ARM64_APPENDED_DTB_IMAGE_NAMES))
ifneq ($(DTB_NAMES),)
DTB_LIST := $(addsuffix .dtb,$(DTB_NAMES))
DTB_OBJS := $(addprefix $(obj)/dts/,$(DTB_LIST))      # <- the branch that matters
else
DTB_OBJS := $(shell find -L $(obj)/dts/ -name \*.dtb)
endif
```

**Some vendor forks resolve `DTB_LIST` and then never use it**, leaving
`Image.gz-dtb` depending on the bare `find` — so the trim knob is decorative and
every board's dtb is appended. On an SDM660 tree that is 27 blobs / ~8 MB, of which
one is wanted, and it is enough on its own to blow the kernel/ramdisk window
(boot-images.md). Check for the `ifneq ($(DTB_NAMES),)` branch before trusting the
config; UBports' `android_kernel_xiaomi_sdm660` has it, tim-ecoder's
`sdm660-4p19` did not.

Enabling the parent `CONFIG_BUILD_ARM64_APPENDED_DTB_IMAGE` also rewrites
`KBUILD_IMAGE` to `$(KBUILD_IMAGE)-dtb` and surfaces a Kconfig *choice*; pin
`CONFIG_IMG_GZ_DTB=y` rather than relying on first-entry-wins. Name the dtb by its
path under `$(obj)/dts/` — e.g. `"vendor/qcom/sdm660-internal-codec-mtp-athena"`.

### Building a 4.19 CAF tree with a modern GCC and Make

Two traps that are not about the kernel at all (found on athena; see
device-athena.md):

- **GNU Make 4.4** (what OE ships as `make-native`) fails every `techpack/audio`
  subdirectory with `scripts/Makefile.lib:408: *** prerequisites cannot be defined
  in recipes`. Two causes: directives inside `ifeq` blocks indented with **TABs**
  (Make 4.4 reads those as recipe lines), and a bare `export` after each
  `include <soc>auto.conf` — Make 4.4 changed export semantics, and exporting
  kbuild's multi-line command macros wholesale makes the sub-make re-parse them as
  makefile text. Replace the bare `export` with the explicit
  `export $(shell sed 's/=.*//' <the conf just included>)`.
- **`CONFIG_CC_WERROR=y` + GCC 12+** turns long-standing vendor patterns into ~90
  build failures. Keep `-Werror` and demote only the benign classes via
  `$(call cc-option,-Wno-error=<x>)`: `format`, `format-extra-args`, `address`,
  `unused-variable`, `maybe-uninitialized`, `unused-result`, `enum-int-mismatch`,
  `attributes`, `parentheses`, `bool-operation`, `duplicate-decl-specifier`,
  `misleading-indentation`, plus `missing-attributes` and `array-parameter` once
  you build modules (qcacld-3.0). Vendor Makefiles carrying **clang-only**
  `-Wno-error=` spellings (`vla-extension`, `typedef-redefinition`,
  `non-literal-null-conversion`, `fortify-source`) must be wrapped in `cc-option`:
  GCC rejects an unknown `-Wno-error=` outright rather than ignoring it.

GCC's stricter analysis is worth the trouble — on athena it found seven genuine
bugs in shipping code, including a `memset` clearing a quarter of its buffer and an
overflowable `copy_from_user` bound check. Fix those at source; silence only the noise.

### LSE atomics on ARMv8.0 SoCs: match the device's reference ROM

`CONFIG_ARM64_USE_LSE_ATOMICS` builds ARMv8.1 atomics alongside the LL/SC ones and
picks at runtime with a static key; on an ARMv8.0 SoC (SDM660: Cortex-A73/A53) it
is dead weight. Whether the shipped ROM has it on depends on that ROM's toolchain,
so read the reference kernel's IKCONFIG rather than assuming. On athena's tree the
ROM's clang made the 4.19 tree mark the assembler `CONFIG_BROKEN_GAS_INST`, so LSE
was never enabled there, while a Yocto build with binutils passes that test and
got a code-generation difference no shipped ROM had — so athena turns it off. On
such a tree a `can't patch jump_label` warning on every boot means a static key
keeps whatever value it had, so do not assume a runtime CPU-feature switch is
inert just because the hardware lacks the feature (found on athena; see
device-athena.md). The opposite also occurs: pioneer's LineageOS 24.0 kernel
(SDM630, clang 22) ships `ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS=y`, and copying athena's LSE-off line
made it the one unexplained difference against that IKCONFIG (device-pioneer.md).

### Framebuffer console as a Tier B debug channel — often does NOT work

Most phones expose no usable UART without a jig, so an early hang shows only as a frozen
bootloader splash, and netconsole / `printk.devkmsg=on` cannot help — they need the
kernel running and the USB gadget up. The obvious idea is to put the kernel log on the
panel:

```
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE_DETECT_PRIMARY=y
CONFIG_FONT_SUPPORT=y   CONFIG_FONT_8x16=y
```

plus `CONFIG_VT` and `console=tty0`.

**Treat this as unproven until you see `Console: switching to colour frame buffer device`
in dmesg.** On athena (msm mdss fbdev, 4.19) it was built exactly as above and fbcon
never took over from the dummy console, although `deferred_takeover` was off,
`register_framebuffer()` is used and the fbcon notifier is registered at
`subsys_initcall` (device-athena.md). Two lessons worth more than the technique:

- Several vendor/community kernels ship `console=tty0` on the cmdline with fbcon
  disabled. That is *not* evidence they simply forgot to enable it — enabling it may not
  be sufficient, and assuming it is leads to a wrong conclusion about why their log is
  silent.
- **On a device whose bootloader splash is never cleared, the splash is not a symptom.**
  It looks identical for a dead kernel and for a fully working boot with a live debug
  shell. Never reason from "stuck on the logo"; get a USB-side signal (adb, the
  initramfs gadget's `iSerial`, or any enumeration at all) before concluding anything
  about where boot stopped.

### The phone's own modules

A rebuilt Tier B kernel refuses the phone's own modules
(`disagrees about version of symbol module_layout`): the stock defconfigs set
`CONFIG_MODVERSIONS`, and the LuneOS fragment changes the config. Where the kernel
source includes the modules, build them; force-load only what you cannot build,
and only after checking struct layouts. Tier B has an ABI to keep too: the stock
kernel's layout as seen by every prebuilt `.ko` on the vendor partition. All of
it is in kmi-crc-matching.md (§ Step −1, § Force-loading prebuilt modules,
§ Struct layouts, § Building and shipping your own modules).

### Build and deploy

A Tier B kernel recipe (e.g. `MACHINE=mindphone bitbake linux-greentouch-mindphone`)
builds the kernel and the boot image in one, under `tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/`.
Verify the image against stock by unpacking and diffing the header fields (see
boot-images.md). Kernel changes belong on a shr-distribution kernel branch rather
than living as layer patches.

### Recurring vendor-kernel patch classes (from the other distros' Tier B experience)

Before inventing fixes, check whether the failure matches a documented class.
UBports' porting-notes GSI wiki
(https://github.com/ubports/porting-notes/wiki/Generic-system-image-(GSI))
catalogues recurring *code* patches for vendor kernels:

- **Samsung Qualcomm devices:** disable RKP (control-flow protection) configs and
  Samsung's file-integrity verifier — otherwise early crashes **with no logs at
  all**.
- **Revert tty workqueue changes** to avoid fastboot bootloops.
- **Revert binder security-context patches** for hwbinder HAL stability.
- **Module "magic mismatch ignore" patches** to load vendor-partition kernel
  modules — their cousin of `CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_LOAD=y`.
- **synx driver PID overflow** on msm-4.19+ kernels.
- **`skip_initramfs` revert** on A8–A10 kernels — without it a repacked boot.img
  never runs your init at all; see boot-images.md for the full trap.

### `pidfd_open()` without `waitid(P_PIDFD)`: GLib reaps nothing (SM-T220, athena, mindphone)

Android's 4.14/4.19 trees carry the 5.3 pidfd work (`pidfd_open()`,
`pidfd_send_signal()`, `CLONE_PIDFD`) but not `waitid(P_PIDFD)`, which is 5.4. Upstream
those are one release apart, so userspace does not probe for the combination:
GLib ≥ 2.74 switches its `GChildWatchSource` to pidfds as soon as `pidfd_open()`
succeeds, then every child reap fails with
`waitid(pid:N, pidfd=M) failed: Invalid argument (22)` and the callback gets a wait
status of -1. Symptoms are in whatever spawns children through GLib: the webOS
media server's pipelines ("exited with status -1"), appinstalld2's package unpack
("Failed to extract package"), anything using `g_spawn` with a child watch.

Check a tree in seconds: `grep -n P_PIDFD include/uapi/linux/wait.h kernel/exit.c`
(absent = broken), or on a running device
`python3 -c "import os,subprocess,time; p=subprocess.Popen(['sleep','0.2']);
fd=os.pidfd_open(p.pid); time.sleep(.5); print(os.waitid(os.P_PIDFD,fd,os.WEXITED))"`.
The fix is upstream commit `3695eae5fee0605f316fbaad0b9e3de791d7dfaf` ("pidfd: add
P_PIDFD to waitid()"); shr-distribution/linux carries a working backport on its
`key2/4.19` and `dnim/4.14.186` branches, and it applied to Samsung's 4.19.191 with
only line-number offsets (five files: `pid.h`, `wait.h`, `exit.c`, `fork.c`,
`signal.c`). On 4.14 it needs one follow-up, "fork: CLONE_PIDFD: do not require a
zeroed *parent_tidptr", because Qt's `QProcess::startDetached()` otherwise fails
with EINVAL; **read `copy_process()` first**, the later 4.19 stable trees do not
have the check and do not need it.

### Vendor trees that stub out `net/bluetooth/hci_sock.c` (Samsung)

Samsung's MediaTek kernels comment out most of `hci_sock.c` and reduce
`hci_sock_create()` to `return 0`. Android never opens an HCI socket. Halium's
bluebinder does (`socket(AF_BLUETOOTH, SOCK_RAW, BTPROTO_HCI)`), `bt_sock_create()`
gets success with `sock->sk == NULL`, and `bt_sock_reclassify_lock()` hits
`BUG_ON(!sk)`; MediaTek's `ipanic_die()` then resets the device, which is a
boot loop of a fixed period (77 s on the SM-T220, 57 s of it in the kernel). Find it
in the ramoops console (`/sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops-0`, readable in TWRP right
after a loop reset). The fix is to make the file identical to the tag again; on
this tree `net/bluetooth/` differed from v4.19.191 in that one file only, so check
with `diff -r` before writing anything clever.

### Legacy 3.x kernels: what the 16.0 GSI and LuneOS assume

Found on a 3.10 MSM8916 kernel (Galaxy A3 (2015); see device-a3-2015-halium.md);
check each on any pre-4.x Tier B port.

- **`COMMAND_LINE_SIZE` 1024 (arch/arm).** CONFIG_CMDLINE, the boot image's command
  line and a Samsung SBL's 775 bytes (passed on by lk2nd) overflow it, and
  everything past the cut is gone without a warning: `androidboot.baseband` (so
  `ro.baseband=unknown` and rmt_storage refuses to run), `androidboot.mode`,
  `androidboot.serialno`, `mdss_mdp.panel`. `wc -c /proc/cmdline` = 1024 is the
  tell. Raise it to 2048 (arm64 has always used 2048).
- **No `MemAvailable` in /proc/meminfo** before 3.14: memorymanager counts 0 MiB
  available and every app launch ends in "Failed to reclaim required memory. All
  apps were closed". The tenderloin commit "mm: add MemAvailable to
  /proc/meminfo" (si_mem_available()) applies unchanged to 3.4 and 3.10 trees;
  hammerhead, mako and bullhead have it.
- **Paranoid networking off breaks vendor daemons that rely on group net_raw**
  (see `ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK` below).
- **No `CONFIG_BT_HCIVHCI` / `CONFIG_RFKILL`** in an old defconfig: bluebinder
  exits "No such device".

---

## The kernel command line

- **Bootloaders mangle it.** sargo's bootloader drops arguments it does not
  recognise (measured with a `zz.marker=1` canary; device-sargo.md), and
  MediaTek's G99 lk drops the first 20 characters of the boot image command line
  (device-q25.md). Anything LuneOS needs goes in `CONFIG_CMDLINE`, not the boot
  image header.
- **Set `CMDLINE` in any recipe that requires meta-oe's `linux.inc`.** It
  unconditionally writes `CONFIG_CMDLINE="${CMDLINE} ${CMDLINE_DEBUG}"`, so with
  `CMDLINE` unset the vendor's built-in string (`root=`, `vmalloc=`, …) is silently
  replaced (found on radon; see device-radon.md).
- **`cgroup_disable=net_prio`** breaks a boot- and shutdown-time deadlock wherever
  LXC + connman run on a MediaTek `ccmni` modem: `net_prio`'s `cgrp_css_online()`
  takes rtnl under cgroup_mutex while connmand holds rtnl waiting on an events
  work item whose kworkers wait on cgroup_mutex (measured on the MP01; see
  device-mp01.md).
- **Never put `netconsole=` on the cmdline of a configfs-gadget kernel**: a
  target whose device does not exist at init makes `init_netconsole()` unwind
  entirely, taking the dynamic configfs interface down with it (verified in the
  athena 4.19 source). Attach dynamically from the initramfs instead (debugging.md)
  and put `printk.devkmsg=on` on the cmdline so the dmesg replay isn't ratelimited.

### selinux=0: do not pass it on a Halium port

The rule is `androidboot.selinux=permissive` and nothing else (the Q25's
`CONFIG_CMDLINE` still carries `selinux=0`; an open issue in device-q25.md). That is
an **Android-init property, not a kernel parameter** — the kernel ignores it, and
the kernel's own SELinux stays enabled. Two reasons:

- **The token is half of a pair where it is copied from.** UBports' SDM660
  `deviceinfo` carries `selinux=0 … apparmor=1 security=apparmor` with
  `CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY="apparmor"`: Ubuntu Touch is swapping the LSM for
  AppArmor, not disabling it. Copying only `selinux=0` puts nothing in the slot, and
  the Android container wants the `security.selinux` xattr handler live. Droidian's
  GKI `CONFIG_CMDLINE` example carries it too.
- **It broke mounting on athena.** With `selinux=0` on a CIP 4.19 tree (the one with
  the backported 5.x LSM framework, § Fragment traps), `mount(2)` returned
  **ENOENT** for every block-backed filesystem while tmpfs mounted; the same kernel
  under Android's recovery ramdisk, without the token, logged
  `SELinux: Initializing.` and mounted ext4. No mechanism is confirmed
  (device-athena.md).

When two boots of *identical kernel bytes* differ, diff the two
`Kernel command line:` lines first — one grep, and often the whole answer. Check
what the rest of your ports do before adding a kernel-side token that only one
device has.

## Cross-distro config lists — use with care

Both UBports and Droidian publish "required kernel config" lists for Halium-style
ports. They are good references — **but both enable options LuneOS leaves off,
some of them KMI-poison on a Tier A kernel.** Know why before copying anything.

UBports' minimal `halium.config`
(https://docs.ubports.com/en/latest/porting/build_and_boot/standalone_kernel_build.html):

```
CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y
CONFIG_FHANDLE=y
CONFIG_SYSVIPC=y
CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
CONFIG_NET_NS=y
CONFIG_PID_NS=y
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
CONFIG_VT=y
```

Droidian's requirements (docs + their 5.10 fragments) likewise mandate
`SYSVIPC`, `IPC_NS`, `PID_NS`, `NET_NS`, `UTS_NS` (FANOTIFY commented out).

LuneOS does not need `SYSVIPC`/`IPC_NS`, and `USER_NS` stays off on the Q25's
tree for KMI reasons (device-q25.md). The difference is architectural, not an
error on either side: UBports and Droidian build a **per-device kernel package**
and do not reload the *stock* vendor modules against it, so KMI preservation is
not a constraint they have. LuneOS Tier A depends on exactly that property. The
rule:

> Cross-distro fragments are good **Tier B** starting points. They must never be
> applied to a **Tier A** GKI kernel without re-running `kmi-crc-check.py` —
> they will break the "stock vendor_dlkm still loads" property.

Maintained fragment source worth watching: **`droidian-devices/common_fragments`**
(https://github.com/droidian-devices/common_fragments) — branches
`4.14-android`, `4.19-android`, `5.10-android-common` (shared 5.10/5.15), each
with `halium.config`, `droidian.config`, `container.config` (Docker/cgroup set)
and `debug.config`, plus `5.10-android12.config`/`5.10-android13.config` deltas.

### Config facts from the other distros (fold into your fragment thinking)

Each item marked (KMI-check) must go through `kmi-crc-check.py` before use on a
Tier A kernel; the rest are behavioral.

- **`CONFIG_ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK` must stay ON** — disabling it for normal
  Linux networking breaks rild on hybris-12.1+ bases. SFOS wraps the capability
  checks in `#ifdef CONFIG_ANDROID_PARANOID_NETWORK` instead of removing the
  option (SFOS hadk-faq). Vendor daemons rely on it too: Qualcomm's
  `rmt_storage` drops to group `net_raw` and fails the IPC router's bind check
  without it, and the modem resets the phone (found on the Galaxy A3 (2015); see
  device-a3-2015-halium.md).
- **`CONFIG_BT_HCIVHCI=y` is bluebinder's kernel prerequisite** — bluebinder
  feeds the Android BT HAL into a virtual HCI (SFOS hadk-hot). The android14-6.1
  fragment carries it as `=m` (the Kleaf route in `build-bootimg.sh` adds
  `hci_vhci` to the GKI module lists).
  Legacy Qualcomm `hci_smd` is `CONFIG_BT_HCISMD` — copy-paste to delete.
- **`CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_RNDIS=y`** enables the RNDIS USB-networking debug
  channel (SSH into a half-booted device — see debugging.md). Droidian's symptom
  mapping: "stuck at the glowing logo and RNDIS is not working → check
  CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_RNDIS" (Droidian docs). Measured device split: stock GKI
  6.1 (bluejay/panther) has RNDIS **off** but `CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_ECM=y`;
  mindphone's 4.14 has RNDIS **on** and ECM off; athena's 4.19 defconfig has
  RNDIS on. The LuneOS initramfs debug network tries both gadget functions, so
  neither needs adding to a fragment just for telnet — but a host talking to
  an ECM gadget must be Linux/macOS (no native Windows driver).
- **`CONFIG_NETCONSOLE=y` + `CONFIG_NETCONSOLE_DYNAMIC=y`** streams kmsg to the
  host over UDP, surviving switch_root (usage: debugging.md). It changes
  `struct net_device`/`net_device_ops`, so it is only safe on a kernel that loads
  no prebuilt vendor network module (kmi-crc-matching.md § NETCONSOLE). The
  tenderloin mainline port instead bakes
  `netconsole=6665@172.16.42.2/usb0,6666@172.16.42.1/` into `CONFIG_CMDLINE`
  for true pre-userspace logging — possible only because it also sets
  `CONFIG_USB_ETH=y` (built-in `g_ether` creates `usb0` at kernel boot); see the
  cmdline rule above for configfs-gadget kernels.
- **pstore/ramoops needs config to exist**: `CONFIG_PSTORE=y`,
  `CONFIG_PSTORE_CONSOLE=y`, `CONFIG_PSTORE_RAM=y`,
  `CONFIG_PSTORE_RAM_ANNOTATION_APPEND=y` (Droidian `debug.config`). Our
  playbook's first debug step assumes ramoops works — on a device that lacks it,
  these options (KMI-check on Tier A) are what create it.
- **Binder device models differ**: Droidian's baseline wants
  `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDERFS=n` with a static
  `CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_DEVICES="binder,hwbinder,vndbinder,anbox-binder,anbox-hwbinder,anbox-vndbinder"`
  — the `anbox-*` triple exists for Waydroid. LuneOS instead mounts **binderfs on
  the host** and binds it into the container. Either model works, but Waydroid
  needs its own binder trio whichever way the nodes are created, plus
  `CONFIG_VETH=y` and `CONFIG_NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_CHECKSUM=y` for its networking
  (Droidian common_fragments).
- **Recent-kernel toggles** seen in Droidian's 5.10 fragments (each KMI-check
  before Tier A use): `CONFIG_LTO_CLANG_FULL=n` + `CONFIG_LTO_CLANG_THIN=y`,
  `CONFIG_ARM64_BTI=n`, `CONFIG_NULL_TTY=y`.
- **Their GKI cmdline example** (in-fragment `CONFIG_CMDLINE`, Droidian):
  `stack_depot_disable=on kasan.stacktrace=off kvm-arm.mode=protected
  cgroup_disable=pressure cgroup.memory=nokmem selinux=0 droidian.lvm.prefer
  console=tty0` — notably `cgroup_disable=pressure`; `console=tty0` also doubles
  as a boot-hang fix (see boot-images.md/debugging.md). Do not copy its
  `selinux=0` (§ selinux=0).

### Vendor floor for the oldest GSI generation

The Halium 9 GSI requires an **Android 9 vendor** as its base — Android 8.0/8.1
vendors are only "experimental" (UBports porting-notes). Record this next to the
vendor-API-level table when triaging very old devices.

## Rebuilding one kernel module without a full kernel build

Bitbake's kernel `do_compile` and plain `make modules` both take ~10 minutes on
a tree this size, because LTO relinks every module. When you only changed one
`.c`, neither is necessary. What does **not** work:

- `make ... drivers/foo/` - builds the objects but never links the `.ko`
- `make ... M=drivers/foo modules` - treats an in-tree dir as an external
  module directory and tries to rebuild unrelated files in it, which fails

What works, in seconds: build the object with the directory target, then link
the module by hand exactly as kbuild would:

```sh
export PATH=<clang-prebuilt>/bin:$PATH
make -C $S O=$B LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=1 ARCH=arm64 \
     CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu- -j64 drivers/regulator/

cd $B && ld.lld -r --build-id=sha1 -T scripts/module.lds \
    -o drivers/regulator/foo.ko \
       drivers/regulator/foo.o drivers/regulator/foo.mod.o
```

The `.mod.o`/`.mod.c` from the previous full build stay valid as long as the
module's exported symbols have not changed. Get the exact flags from bitbake's
own `temp/run.do_compile.*`, which records the make line verbatim.

Verify before flashing: `strings foo.ko | grep <a string from your change>`.

Combined with the fact that **our modules load fine next to the vendor's**
(same vermagic, KMI verified), this makes single-driver experiments a
sub-minute loop with `adb push` + `rmmod`/`insmod`, instead of a
build-flash-reboot cycle.
