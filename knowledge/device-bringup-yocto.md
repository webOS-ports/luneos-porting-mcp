# Device Bring-up in meta-smartphone / Yocto

How a LuneOS device port is wired into the Yocto build: repo and layer geography, what a
machine conf must contain, the generic `halium-arm64` machine, the GKI boot-image machine
pattern proven on bluejay (Pixel 6a) and panther (Pixel 7), the android-system-image recipe
mechanics, LXC container config, 32-bit pitfalls from mindphone (MT6739), and the build
failures worth remembering. Everything here was established on real hardware during the
sargo/bluejay/panther/mindphone ports (Aug–Sep 2026).

## ANDROID_BOOTIMG_* changes do not always re-run do_deploy

`kernel_android.bbclass` reads the boot-image addresses in a loop:

```python
for key, var in (("cmdline",     "ANDROID_BOOTIMG_CMDLINE"),
                 ("kerneladdr",  "ANDROID_BOOTIMG_KERNEL_RAM_BASE"),
                 ("ramdiskaddr", "ANDROID_BOOTIMG_RAMDISK_RAM_BASE"), ...):
    cmd += ["-c", "%s=%s" % (key, d.getVar(var))]
```

Because the variable name reaches `d.getVar()` through `var` rather than as a
literal, bitbake's dependency scanner cannot see the reference, so changing one of
these in the recipe **may not invalidate `do_deploy`** — the build succeeds, reports
no error, and silently redeploys the previous boot image. Always follow such a
change with:

```sh
MACHINE=<m> bitbake -f -c deploy linux-<vendor>-<device>
```

and then verify the produced image rather than trusting the build (see the
kernel/ramdisk window check in boot-images.md). This bit athena twice in one
session: once when a dropped `ANDROID_BOOTIMG_RAMDISK_RAM_BASE` silently fell back
to the bbclass default `?= "0x00000000"` — a ramdisk load address of zero, which
the build is perfectly happy to emit — and once when restoring it appeared to
change nothing.

A missing `*_RAM_BASE` is worth calling out on its own: the default is `0x0`, so a
recipe that loses the line produces an image whose ramdisk is loaded at address
zero. Nothing in the build complains.

## Repo and layer geography

- **`meta-smartphone` is the repo, not the layer.** `meta-smartphone/meta-android` is a
  separate Yocto layer with its own `layer.conf`, already generic: libhybris,
  android-headers, the GSI recipe base, initramfs and lxc-android live there, and no recipe
  in it names a device. The planned `meta-halium` layer was deliberately dropped — all GSI
  work lives in `meta-smartphone/meta-android`.
- Vendor layers hold the device machines: `meta-smartphone/meta-google` (sargo, bluejay,
  panther), `meta-smartphone/meta-greentouch` (mindphone), plus `meta-xiaomi`,
  `meta-oneplus`, etc. Long-term these are deleted for Halium/GSI targets and kept only for
  mainline/legacy non-Treble devices.
- LuneOS distro bits: `meta-webos-ports/meta-luneos` (nyx-modules recipe, defaulttunes,
  the HAL glue recipes: libgbinder, ofono-binder-plugin, pulseaudio-modules-droid,
  bluebinder, sensorfw, qt6-qpa-hwcomposer-plugin, nyx-modules-hybris, waydroid, …).
- **Target branch: `Herrie82/meta-smartphone` → `herrie/wrynose`. scarthgap is dead.**
  The abandoned prior art is the single-commit `herrie/kirkstone-halium9-gsi` branch
  (`daf7fb55`), which is a mido config wearing a generic name — see the migration plan
  before reusing anything from it.
- Build tree: `/media/herrie/LuneOS/wrynose/webos-ports`, entered with
  `MACHINE=<machine> . ./setup-env`. mindphone uses TMPDIR `/home/herrie/wrynose-tmp/tmp`
  (webos-ports/tmp symlinks there).

## What a machine conf contains

Real examples on disk:

**`meta-google/conf/machine/sargo.conf`** (legacy Tier B, Pixel 3a):
- `PREFERRED_VERSION_android-headers-halium = "9.0%"`
- `VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_android-system-image = "android-system-image-sargo"`
- `PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-google-sargo"` (4.9.124, LineageOS `bonito`
  defconfig)
- Hardcoded `ANDROID_BOARD_BOOTIMAGE_PARTITION = /dev/block/mmcblk0p13`, partition sizes,
  `SERIAL_CONSOLE`. Also still pulls in `xserver-xorg` + `xf86-video-fbdev` — dead weight.

**`meta-greentouch/conf/machine/mindphone.conf`** (32-bit MTK): `TARGET_ARCH=arm` +
`tune-cortexa8`, `KERNEL_IMAGETYPE = zImage`, `SERIAL_CONSOLE ttyMT0`, by-name boot
partition path, `PREFERRED_VERSION_android-headers-halium` bumped `11.0%` → `16.0%` when
the device moved to the Halium 16 arm32 GSI.

**android-headers rule (settled on sargo, contrary to what the 13.0/14.0 recipes state):
the android-headers version has to track the GSI, not the vendor.** libhybris gates its
Android 16 support on `ANDROID_VERSION_MAJOR >= 16` and that macro comes from this package.
Verified safe for the vendor ABI: `gralloc.h`, `hwcomposer2.h`, `hardware.h`, `lights.h`
are byte-identical between 11.0 and 16.0, and `audio_hw_device`'s member order is unchanged
with four fields appended.

**`meta-android/conf/machine/include/meta-android-halium.inc`** carries
`MACHINEOVERRIDES =. "halium:"`, libhybris as `virtual/egl|mesa|libgles*`, `ofono-halium`,
`initramfs-scripts-halium` — and `TUNE_PKGARCH:append = "-halium"`, the historical scaling
blocker (every package becomes `aarch64-halium`).

## The generic `halium-arm64` machine

One universal arm64 rootfs, no kernel, no GSI baked in. Boots the Pixel 3a on both the
Halium 14.0 and 16.0 GSIs over its stock Android 12.1 vendor, `systemctl
is-system-running = running`, 0 failed units.

```
PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-dummy"   # no kernel in the rootfs build
MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RDEPENDS = ""
IMAGE_FSTYPES = "ext4 tar.gz"
```

**Do NOT drop `TUNE_PKGARCH:append = "-halium"`** (revised 2026-08-24): `aarch64` is
already produced by non-Halium arm64 machines (pinetab2) and TMPDIR is shared, so removing
the taint would mix libhybris-linked and mesa-linked packages in one feed. The actual
enemy is the **MACHINE_ARCH feed**: 49 recipes were machine-arch for sargo, measured with
`meta-android/scripts/check-machine-arch.sh`. The CI gate that keeps the rootfs universal:

```sh
# fail the build if any package in the image is MACHINE_ARCH
find tmp/deploy/ipk -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name 'all' ! -name 'aarch64*' ! -name noarch
```

Anything landing in a `halium-arm64/` feed dir is a bug — move it to the adaptation repo.

## GKI device machines (bluejay / panther pattern, 4 Sep 2026)

Both devices build boot images from bitbake:

```
MACHINE=bluejay bitbake initramfs-android-image
MACHINE=bluejay bitbake luneos-bootimg-gki      # same for panther
```

Output in `tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/`: `boot-<machine>-luneos.img`,
`boot-<machine>-luneos-debug.img`, and on panther `init_boot-panther-luneos.img`. All
header v4, header_size 1584; panther's boot has `ramdisk=0`, its init_boot has `kernel=0`.

Files that make it work:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `meta-android/lib/halium/bootimg.py` | v3/v4 boot image writer — verified **byte-identical** to AOSP `mkbootimg.py` for all four shipped shapes (kernel-only, ramdisk-only, kernel+ramdisk, kernel+ramdisk+`enable_adb`) |
| `meta-android/classes/kernel_android.bbclass` | routes header_version >= 3 to the new writer; stops splitting an appended dtb for v3+ (no dtb section exists) |
| `meta-android/classes/gki_bootimg.bbclass` | packs a **prebuilt** GKI kernel + the machine initramfs |
| `meta-google/conf/machine/{bluejay,panther}.conf` | the machines |
| `meta-google/recipes-bsp/gki-bootimg/luneos-bootimg-gki_1.0.bb` | the packing recipe |
| `meta-luneos/…/nyx-modules/{bluejay,panther}.cmake` | copies of halium-arm64.cmake — **a machine without one does not parse** |

**The kernel deliberately stays outside bitbake.**
`PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel = "linux-dummy"`, and `GKI_KERNEL_IMAGE` (set in
`local.conf`) points at the Image that `build-bootimg.sh` produced from the ACK/Bazel tree.
Rebuilding ACK with OE's cross toolchain would move the exported-symbol CRCs under
`CONFIG_MODVERSIONS` and the stock vendor modules would stop loading — which is the whole
Tier A property (stock `vendor_boot`/`vendor_dlkm` modules keep loading against our
kernel). `do_deploy[file-checksums]` hashes that file so a new kernel really rebuilds the
images instead of returning stale sstate.

**`ANDROID_BOOTIMG_INIT_BOOT = "1"`** is what splits the output into a kernel-only `boot`
plus a ramdisk-only `init_boot` (panther, A13-launch layout). bluejay sets `"0"` and gets
one combined `boot.img` (A12-launch layout, no init_boot partition).

The bitbake initramfs is the stock `initramfs-scripts-halium` one, so the two
hardware-diagnosed GKI initramfs bugs had to move upstream before bitbake images were
shippable: `init.sh` now carries the dependency-ordered module loader and cmdline module
parameters (verified byte-identical to the hand-patched `init`), and
`0002-halium-size-userdata-from-sysfs-not-proc-partitions.patch` carries the
userdata-resize fix. Bonus: the bitbake ramdisk was *newer* than the hand-built kits —
it includes `0001-halium-find-the-Android-image-instead-of-assuming-whe.patch` (30 Aug),
which fixes the "userdata image with only rootfs.img in it does not boot" case that the
flashed-userdata install relies on. Both staging kits were re-cut from the bitbake images.

## Build commands

```sh
cd /media/herrie/LuneOS/wrynose/webos-ports && . ./setup-env

MACHINE=bluejay   bitbake initramfs-android-image
MACHINE=bluejay   bitbake luneos-bootimg-gki
MACHINE=panther   bitbake luneos-bootimg-gki
MACHINE=mindphone bitbake luneos-dev-image          # full image (long)

# mindphone kernel (Tier B, in-tree BSP kernel):
MACHINE=mindphone bitbake -R /media/herrie/LuneOS/wrynose/gsi11-limits.conf \
    linux-greentouch-mindphone
# → deploys zImage-mindphone.fastboot (= boot.img) under tmp/deploy/images/mindphone/
```

Repack inputs live under `tmp/deploy/images/`: e.g.
`tmp/deploy/images/halium-arm64/luneos-image-halium-arm64.rootfs.tar.gz` and
`tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/initramfs-android-image-<machine>.cpio.gz`.

## android-system-image recipes

- `android-system-image.inc` is fully on **`${UNPACKDIR}`** (`.../<pv>/sources`) — any new
  GSI recipe must use it, not `${WORKDIR}` (UNPACKDIR sweep commits `dde5391a` +
  `0b37a1ae`).
- The `.inc` consumes `${UNPACKDIR}/system.img` in place (`mv` → `simg2img` → `rm`), keeps
  the sparse→ext4 conversion and the `/android/{system,vendor,data,...}` symlink logic —
  already generation-agnostic.
- `ANDROID_SYSTEM_IMAGE_DESTNAME = "android-rootfs.img"` — correct because the generic
  `halium_arm64` GSI is **system-as-root** (`/init`, `/system`, `/vendor`, `/odm` at the
  image root), so `pre-start.sh` takes its `[ -e /android/init ]` branch. `/vendor` inside
  the GSI is a real empty directory (0755, gid 2000), a clean mount point for either a
  loop-mounted `vendor.img` or the device's stock vendor.
- The **Test A dual-tarball pattern** (`android-system-image-sargo.bb`): fetch both the
  device tarball and the generic GSI tarball, select with a variable, always take
  `vendor.img` from the device tarball:

```bitbake
SARGO_ANDROID_SYSTEM ?= "gsi"     # or "device"

SRC_URI = "\
    ...halium-luneos-9.0-${PV}-${MACHINE}.tar.bz2;name=device;subdir=device \
    ...halium-luneos-9.0-${GSI_PV}-halium_arm64.tar.bz2;name=gsi;subdir=gsi \
"

do_install:prepend() {
    cp ${UNPACKDIR}/${SARGO_ANDROID_SYSTEM}/system.img ${UNPACKDIR}/system.img
    cp ${UNPACKDIR}/device/vendor.img ${UNPACKDIR}/vendor.img
}
```

The copy sits in `do_install:prepend` rather than a `do_unpack` postfunc because the `.inc`
consumes `${UNPACKDIR}/system.img` in place, so re-copying keeps a re-run idempotent.
Reverting is `SARGO_ANDROID_SYSTEM = "device"` in `local.conf` — no refetch.

- mindphone points at its 32-bit GSI the same way:
  `android-system-image-mindphone.bb` → `halium-luneos-16.0-20260827-1-halium_arm.tar.bz2`
  (382 MB android-rootfs.img), via `file://` until published on
  `webOS-ports/halium-images`.
- Published generic GSIs: `webOS-ports/halium-images` hosts `halium_arm64` releases for
  9.0/10.0/11.0; 14.0 and 16.0 tarballs exist in `DL_DIR` only
  (`halium-luneos-<ver>-<date>-N-halium_arm64.tar.bz2`) — publishing them is an open
  action item.

## LXC container config

Historical bugs in `meta-android/recipes-core/android-system/` and their fixes
(`9b32def7`, plus Droidian comparisons):

- `lxc.arch` is now derived from `TARGET_ARCH` (was hardcoded `armhf` — wrong on arm64,
  but armhf targets still exist in the tree, so derive, don't flip).
- `lxc.uts.name` corrected from `armhf` to `android`.
- binderfs mounted on the host and bound in as optional.
- APEX handled by UBports' `mount-apexes.py`, which pre-mounts the minimal
  runtime/art/i18n/vndk set the linker needs before the container starts. Required from
  Android 10 — libraries move into APEXes and libhybris cannot find them otherwise.
- `/apex`, `/odm`, `/vendor_dlkm` need no container entries in LuneOS — unlike Droidian,
  LuneOS mounts under `/android`, which *is* the container root (same inode). Droidian's
  reference config marks these `optional` so they cost nothing on older devices.
- Dynamic partitions: `mount-android.sh` (ported from Droidian) runs as `ExecStartPre` of
  `android-system.service` — not from the initramfs, where udev, `dmsetup` and
  `parse-android-dynparts` are unavailable. It handles A/B slot from `/proc/bootconfig` or
  `/proc/cmdline`, searches `by-partlabel`/`by-name`/`by-label`/`by-path`/`by-uuid`/
  `by-partuuid`/`by-id` trying `<name>$slot` before `<name>`, validates the mount via
  `/vendor/build.prop`, and maps `super` via `dmsetup create --concise` fed by
  `parse-android-dynparts`. Retrofit dynamic partitions (metadata on `system`, extents
  spanning `system`+`vendor`, no `super` — sargo from Android 11) are supported
  (`03508c3e`) and covered by `tests/loopback-retrofit-test.sh` (22 assertions).
- LXC 4.0.12 on a 4.14/arm32 kernel: legacy clone kept `CLONE_PIDFD` → `EINVAL`; patched
  in the lxc recipe (mindphone).
- Note the kernel-side constraint from the bluejay KMI work: with `IPC_NS` off (KMI-poison
  list), **LXC must not unshare the IPC namespace**; `PID_NS` is available.

## 32-bit arch pitfalls (mindphone)

- The port was originally set up arm64 (arch-arm64.inc, Image.gz-dtb, qcom cmdline, arm64
  defconfig, halium_arm64 GSI) — wrong on every count for a 32-bit-stock device
  (`bootopt=64S3,32S1,32S1`: 64-bit SoC, 32-bit kernel + userland). Check the stock kernel
  arch first.
- `TARGET_ARCH=arm` + `tune-cortexa8` — same tune as hammerhead/tenderloin, so it shares
  their halium sstate.
- **The webruntime tune split:** the distro builds webruntime (Chromium) with thumb
  disabled, so it lands in `cortexa8hf-neon-halium` while everything else is
  `cortexa8t2hf-neon-halium`. `meta-luneos/conf/distro/include/defaulttunes.inc` bridges
  the two arches per-machine via `PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS` — mindphone was missing from that
  list (tenderloin/hammerhead/mako precedent). Symptom: image build dies at wam-clang with
  "sstate manifest could not be found". Fix: add `DEFAULTTUNE:mindphone` +
  `PACKAGE_EXTRA_ARCHS:append:mindphone` there. Do not retune the machine — an old
  `cortexa8hf-neon-halium` Chromium sstate predates the `INSANE_SKIP 32bit-time` change,
  its hashes can never match, and retuning invalidates every cached task anyway.
- Building a 4.14 BSP kernel with gcc 14/binutils 2.4x took six rounds of layer patches:
  obsolete `#alloc` section-flag syntax in 28 arm32 asm files (backport of upstream
  790756c7e022); `%llx` vs 32-bit `phys_addr_t`; drop `-Werror` from 30 MTK vendor
  Makefiles; re-enable a commented-out touchscreen algorithm object needed at vmlinux
  link; disable GSL_GESTURE + fix an unguarded u64 division; rename `constexpr` in
  `unifdef.c` (a C23 keyword — same fix as sargo's host tools, where the host GCC now
  defaults to `-std=gnu23`). Plus `CONFIG_FRAME_WARN=2048`.

## Build failures worth remembering

1. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'halium'` — modern bitbake does not put a layer's
   `lib/` on sys.path by itself; the layer needs `addpylib ${LAYERDIR}/lib halium` in
   `conf/layer.conf`.
2. `do_package` failed on a missing `packages-split` even with `PACKAGES = ""`. An
   image-only recipe needs `inherit nopackages` (deletes the packaging tasks), not just an
   empty package list.
3. `S = "${WORKDIR}"` is rejected outright by this Yocto ("no longer supported"); a recipe
   with no sources wants `S = "${UNPACKDIR}"`.
4. bash 5.3 (new in wrynose) cannot `source` sysfs uevent files — the failed source aborted
   `mdev-partlabel.sh` before its blkid branch, leaving `/dev/disk/by-partlabel` empty.
   Fixed (`23edbee8`) by parsing `/sys/.../uevent` instead of sourcing it. By-name
   partition symlinks are what let a generic build mount the stock vendor as
   `/dev/disk/by-partlabel/vendor$slot` instead of hardcoding `mmcblk0p*`.
5. `unifdef.c` declares `static bool constexpr;` — C23 made that a keyword; pin the host C
   standard or rename (hit on both sargo's 4.9 host tools and mindphone's 4.14 tree).

## Device-agnostic principles (migration plan §6.5/§6.6)

When adding per-device config, prefer this order:

- **Tier 0 — derive at runtime** (target: everything): HAL services, init gates and node
  permissions from the container's own rc files; display density from `ro.sf.lcd_density`
  and geometry from hwcomposer/DRM; partitions by name + `slot_suffix`; vendor API level
  from `ro.board.api_level`/`ro.vndk.version` (never `ro.build.version.release`); RIL
  topology enumerated from hwservicemanager.
- **Tier 1 — `deviceinfo`** (declarative, UBports/postmarketOS-compatible names:
  `deviceinfo_codename`, `deviceinfo_bootimg_header_version`, `deviceinfo_flash_offset_*`,
  …): only what cannot be read off a running device.
- **Tier 2 — `sparse/` file overlay** (last resort; every file needs a stated reason it
  cannot be derived). Applied non-destructively: overlayfs when `/proc/filesystems`
  advertises it, bind-mounts otherwise — never copied in, or the universal rootfs stops
  being universal. Note sargo's 4.9 kernel has no `CONFIG_OVERLAY_FS`; do not use
  oe-core's `overlayfs-etc.bbclass` (wrong problem, reintroduces per-machine device
  nodes).
- **Shipped config files are placeholders, not defaults.** Device-describing values must be
  obviously invalid (zeros, `/dev/input/PLACEHOLDER`); a plausible constant is worse than a
  broken one. Never read a value back out of a file you generate; genuine fallbacks live in
  the generator. (Real incidents: `luna-platform.conf` shipped `DPI=445` and
  `50-luna-platform` read it back as a fallback; `nyx.conf` shipped sargo's key nodes;
  `surface-manager.env` shipped sargo's touchscreen node.)
- An unknown device must still boot to a usable UI from Tier 0 alone.
