# Device: q25 (Zinwa Q25 / Q25 Pro)

The first MediaTek Tier A (GKI) target, the first LuneOS port onto a square screen, and the port that produced the method's sharpest correction so far: **"GKI device" does not imply "an ACK kernel will do"**. MT6789 ships MediaTek's *mgk* GKI derivative, not pure GKI, and an ACK build scored 344 of 344 stock vendor modules failing to load before the device-tree build scored 0. It also confirms that the KMI-poison list is a property of a specific KMI-plus-tree rather than of GKI in the abstract - though SYSVIPC poisoned and PID_NS stayed clean here exactly as on bluejay's android14-6.1. BlackBerry Classic chassis, Helio G99, 3.5" 720x720 1:1 panel, physical QWERTY and trackpad. Working notes: `/home/herrie/webos/LuneOS/zinwa/zinwa-q25-notes.md`; Yocto: layer `meta-smartphone/meta-zinwa`, `MACHINE=q25`.

Status: **a KMI-verified kernel and boot image now build from this tree.**
`boot-q25-luneos.img` (27 MB, 40% of the 64 MiB partition) reproduces the stock
header field for field, and all **344 stock vendor modules still load against
our kernel with zero CRC mismatches**. Nothing has touched hardware yet. The
stock firmware has been obtained and dissected (`drive.zinwa.com` → Google Drive → `OS-Images/Q25/
MassProduction/With-GMS/OS-new-camera-0120-Q25-GMS.zip`, 2.53 GiB, build
`SP1A.210812.016`, 20 Jan 2026). Every "unverified" item in the first draft of
these notes is now settled from that archive. Remaining: build the kernel, run
the KMI check, then hardware.

## Platform facts

All verified from the device's own LineageOS device tree
(`LineageOS/android_device_xelex_Q25`, `lineage-23.2`), its GPL kernel tree
(`LineageOS/android_kernel_xelex_mt6789`), and the Droidian port
(`JamiKettunen/droidian-zinwa-q25` + `gitlab.com/deathmist/halium-gki`
branch `q25-droidian`). Not from hardware.

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Codename / vendor | `Q25` (capital Q), `xelex`. Board name `q20_v12_factory` |
| SoC / GPU | MediaTek Helio G99 = **MT6789**, Mali (`ro.hardware.vulkan=mali`); EGL driver is `libGLES_meow.so` (`ro.hardware.egl=meow`) |
| CPU | arm64, cortex-a76 + cortex-a55, armv8-2a |
| RAM / storage | 12 GB, 256 GB UFS (228 GiB userdata stock) |
| Panel | 3.5" 720x720 IPS, driver `panel-q20-hd720-lcm-dsi-vdo.ko`. True 291 ppi; LineageOS ships density 193 |
| Stock Android | **12** (`SP1A.210812.016`). `ro.vndk.version=31`, `ro.board.first_api_level=31`, `ro.vendor.build.version.sdk=31`. The Android 14 build *fingerprint* on system/product/odm is an attestation spoof — every real platform property says 12 |
| Kernel | `5.10.198-android12-9-gfcab0aff02db`, clang **r416183b** (12.0.5), `Image.gz` → KMI **android12-5.10 generation 9**. `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y`, `MODULE_SIG_FORCE` not set |
| Partitions | A/B, dynamic (`super` 9216 MiB), separate `metadata` 32 MiB. `init_boot_a/b` exist in the scatter (8 MiB) but are **unused** — no `init_boot.img` ships and nothing flashes one |
| boot | header **v4**, 64 MiB. kernel 20,174,525 B + ramdisk 1,189,717 B (non-zero → generic ramdisk rides here). os_version 12.0.0, patch 2024-03, **cmdline empty** |
| vendor_boot | 64 MiB, header v4, one ramdisk fragment (18.9 MB gzip), dtb 184,000 B. cmdline `bootopt=64S3,32N2,64N2 buildvariant=user`. 180 early modules incl. `bbqX0kbd.ko`, `8250_mtk.ko` |
| AVB | enabled, boot rollback index 1, vbmeta + vbmeta_system + vbmeta_vendor |
| Console | `8250_mtk.ko` → `ttyS0`. Stock vendor_boot cmdline asks for `console=tty0` |
| Wi-Fi / BT | connac1x combo, `gen4m_6789`, control node `/dev/wmtWifi` |
| Modem | single SIM (`ro.telephony.sim.count=1`), VoLTE/VoWiFi props present |
| SPL | 2024-03-05 |
| Vendor modules | **344 unique**: 180 in the vendor_boot ramdisk + 184 in `vendor_dlkm_a` (32.2 MiB, inside super) |
| Camera | `imx111_mipi_raw` + `s5kjn1_mipi_raw`; modem `q20v1_a_ulwctg_cogps` |

### The keyboard, which is the interesting part

`drivers/input/keyboard/bbqX0kbd/` in the GPL kernel tree — Zinwa's fork of
wallComputer's driver, talking over I2C to an RP2040 running solderparty
`i2c_puppet` firmware. Contrary to what the Droidian wiki assumes, the source
*is* published (though `bbqX0kbd_main.o_shipped` sits next to the `.c`, so
part of it ships prebuilt).

- It registers **one** input device, `input->name = "Q25_keyboard"`, carrying
  `EV_KEY` *and* `EV_REL` (`REL_X`/`REL_Y`) *and* `BTN_LEFT`/`BTN_RIGHT`. The
  QWERTY, the toolbelt keys and the trackpad are all that one node. The stock
  `.kl`/`.kcm`/`.idc` are keyed on the same name.
- `/proc/q20_switch_key_mouse`: `0` (the driver default) → the trackpad reports
  relative motion, i.e. a pointer. `1` → it accumulates offsets and emits
  `KEY_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT` past a threshold, i.e. a d-pad. LuneOS wants the
  default.
- `/proc/q20_spec_power_flag`: `1` enables wake-on-`Call end` (stock Android
  exposes it as "Keyboard function switching"), at some idle-power cost.
- `/proc/firmware_upgrade`: `1` then `2` while holding `Call end` puts the MCU
  in mass-storage mode for a `.uf2` firmware update. Without holding `Call end`
  the same sequence puts the keyboard into "PC mode" over USB.
- `bbqX0kbd.ko` is in `modules.load.ramdisk`, so it loads from `vendor_boot` —
  the keyboard is alive in the initramfs, which is worth a great deal when
  debugging a device with no UART.

Power and volume are separate and conventional: `mtk-pmic-keys.c` registers
`"mtk-pmic-keys"`, `mtk-kpd.c` registers the matrix keypad.

## The kernel decision, and the measurement that reversed it

The Q25 looks like a textbook Tier A device — GKI boot image, `android12-5.10`
KMI generation 9, stock `vendor_boot` and `vendor_dlkm`, `CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y`
with no `MODULE_SIG_FORCE`. So the port first did the Tier A thing: ACK
`android12-5.10` (via the Halium/Droidian fork, which carries MT6789 `gki_quirks`
and a SYSVIPC-in-ABI-padding patch), built with the Clang the KMI was frozen
with.

**That kernel scored 344 of 344 stock vendor modules failing to load**, with
`module_layout` itself mismatching — a total CRC shift, not a stray option.

The reason is in the stock kernel's own IKCONFIG: `CONFIG_ARCH_MEDIATEK=y` and
~1,200 options `gki_defconfig` does not have. **MediaTek does not ship pure GKI
on MT6789.** Their kernel is *mgk*: `gki_defconfig` merged with
`mgk_64_k510_defconfig` (646 lines, 280 `CONFIG_MTK*`), then
`entry_level.config`, then the board's `q20_v12_factory.config` — on a tree that
carries `drivers/misc/mediatek` and `drivers/gpu/mediatek` out of tree. The stock
modules' CRCs follow that. No ACK build of any vintage can match them.

So the port builds the **device's own kernel**, from
`LineageOS/android_kernel_xelex_mt6789` (`lineage-23.2`, at 5.10.198 — exactly
the stock kernel's version), with the device's own four-fragment config chain
plus a LuneOS delta. The KMI discipline is unchanged — stock `vendor_boot` and
`vendor_dlkm` stay, we replace only the kernel — but the baseline to reproduce is
MediaTek's, not Google's.

This is worth generalising: **"GKI device" does not imply "ACK kernel will do".**
The test is cheap and decisive (`kmi-crc-check.py` against the stock `.ko` set)
and it should be run before assuming the one-kernel-per-KMI property holds.

### The bisect

All numbers against the full 344-module set (180 from the `vendor_boot` ramdisk
+ 184 from `vendor_dlkm`), `kmi-crc-check.py`:

| Kernel | Result |
|---|---|
| ACK 5.10.250 (Halium fork) + `gki_defconfig` + droidian + LuneOS fragments | **344 of 344 would fail** |
| device tree 5.10.198, device config chain, **no** LuneOS delta | **0 would fail** |
| + full LuneOS delta incl. `SYSVIPC`/`IPC_NS`/`USER_NS` | **344 would fail** |
| + LuneOS delta with those held out | **0 would fail** ← shipped |

**KMI-poison list for MediaTek mgk android12-5.10 on MT6789:**
`CONFIG_SYSVIPC` (with `SYSVIPC_SYSCTL`, `IPC_NS`) and `CONFIG_USER_NS`.

Everything else LuneOS needs is clean: `PID_NS`, `CHECKPOINT_RESTORE`,
`DEVTMPFS(+MOUNT)`, `FHANDLE`, `TMPFS_XATTR`/`POSIX_ACL`, `AUTOFS_FS`, `VT`,
`QUOTA_NETLINK_INTERFACE`, `UEVENT_HELPER`, `STATIC_USERMODEHELPER=n`, the whole
netfilter/PPP/L2TP block, the bluez/vhci set, `VETH`. That `PID_NS` is clean and
`SYSVIPC` is not is **the same answer bluejay's bisect gave on android14-6.1** —
two different SoCs, two different KMIs, same shape.

The two poisoned options were held out as a group, not separated from each other;
neither is needed, so the extra build was not spent.

Userland consequences, and they are real:
- No SysV IPC — watch Qt's `QSharedMemory`/`QSystemSemaphore`. POSIX shm and
  semaphores are unaffected.
- LXC must not unshare the IPC or user namespaces. `PID_NS` is available.

Escape hatch if SysV IPC ever turns out to be load-bearing: the Halium fork of
ACK carries *"GKI: use Android ABI padding for SYSVIPC task_struct fields"*,
which puts the new members in the reserved KABI padding so the CRCs do not move.
Cherry-picking it onto the MTK tree is untried but is the known shape of the fix.

### 5.10 kbuild gotchas (not device-specific — expect them on any 5.10 port)

Three of these cost a build cycle each:

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `register 'sp' unsuitable for global register variables on this target` in `asm-offsets.c` | 5.10 derives clang's `--target` from `CROSS_COMPILE`; `LLVM=1` alone does not imply one (6.1 works it out from `ARCH`). clang was building for the x86_64 host | `CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-` — only the triple is used, no GNU binutils needed |
| wants an external assembler | 5.10 defaults to `-fno-integrated-as` | `LLVM_IAS=1` |
| whole kernel compiles, then `link-vmlinux.sh: python: not found` | 5.10 still spells `PYTHON` as `python`, and calls `scripts/jobserver-exec` | `PYTHON=python3`. Droidian's CI symlinks `python`→`python2`, which is both host-wide and the wrong interpreter — `jobserver-exec` parses clean as python3 |

Plus `CROSS_COMPILE_COMPAT=arm-linux-gnueabi-`, because `CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO=y`.

## What was wired up

Everything below is in place and `MACHINE=q25 bitbake --dry-run
luneos-bootimg-gki` resolves the full graph (1657 tasks).

**New layer `meta-smartphone/meta-zinwa`** (added to `conf/bblayers.conf`):

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `conf/layer.conf` | `zinwa-layer`, depends on core + openembedded-layer + android-layer |
| `conf/machine/q25.conf` | the machine. Boot-image only, like bluejay: no rootfs, no GSI baked in |
| `recipes-core/udev/udev-extraconf/70-q25.rules` | `Q25_keyboard` input tagging, `wmtWifi`/`stpbt`/`stpgps`/`conninfra_dev`/`accdet` ownership. Installed into the **generic halium-arm64 rootfs**, as sargo's are |
| `recipes-core/luneos-device-config/.../Q25-deviceinfo` | Tier 1: key devices, display DPI, device pixel ratio. Installed as `adaptations/Q25` with a lowercase symlink |
| `recipes-kernel/linux/linux-zinwa-q25_git.bb` + `files/luneos.cfg` | **the kernel** — device tree, device config chain, LuneOS delta, KMI-verified |

**`meta-smartphone/meta-android`** (generic):

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| *(an ACK `android12-5.10` recipe lived here briefly and was removed once measurement showed it cannot serve this device — see above. The 6.1 one is untouched.)* |
| `recipes-bsp/gki-bootimg/luneos-bootimg-gki_1.0.bb` | **moved here from meta-google** and gated on `GKI_BOOTIMG = "1"` instead of a `^(bluejay\|panther)$` regex, so adding a GKI device is one line in its own machine conf. The recipe never was Google-specific; the class it inherits already lived here |
| `classes/gki_bootimg.bbclass` | `GKI_KERNEL_IMAGE_NAME` (default `Image.lz4`) so a machine can ask for `Image.gz` |
| `recipes-core/udev/udev-extraconf/65-android.rules` | `/dev/mali0` 0666 `system:graphics`, next to the existing `kgsl` and `pvr_sync` rules. Device-class, not q25-specific — same failure mode as pvr_sync (only root gets a GL context, so the compositor renders and every sandboxed GPU process does not) |

**`meta-smartphone/meta-google`**: `GKI_BOOTIMG = "1"` and
`PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-halium-gki = "6.1%"` added to `bluejay.conf` and
`panther.conf` — behaviour unchanged, they just now say out loud which KMI they
want, because there are two.

**`meta-webos-ports/meta-luneos`**: `nyx-modules/q25.cmake`, a copy of
`halium-arm64.cmake` (a machine without one does not parse).

**`conf/local.conf`**: `GKI_CLANG_DIR:q25` / `GKI_BUILD_TOOLS_DIR:q25`
machine-scoped, because android12-5.10 wants clang **r416183b** and the
existing unscoped values are android14-6.1's **r487747c**. Machine overrides
win over the plain assignments for `MACHINE=q25` only; bluejay and panther are
untouched.

## Build

```sh
# once: the KMI's own toolchain (clang-r416183b, ~3 GB, prebuilts only)
/home/herrie/webos/LuneOS/zinwa/fetch-gki-toolchain.sh

cd /media/herrie/LuneOS/wrynose/webos-ports && . ./setup-env

MACHINE=q25 bitbake linux-zinwa-q25          # Image.gz + Module.symvers + kernel-config
MACHINE=q25 bitbake initramfs-android-image
MACHINE=q25 bitbake luneos-bootimg-gki       # boot-q25-luneos.img, -debug.img
```

Output in `tmp/deploy/images/q25/`. The rootfs is the shared one:

```sh
MACHINE=halium-arm64 bitbake luneos-dev-image
```

Timing, so nobody thinks it has hung: the kernel is ~20 min, almost all of it
the single-threaded `LTO vmlinux.o` link (the device config uses
`LTO_CLANG_FULL`). Editing `files/luneos.cfg` at all — comments included —
rehashes the task and costs a full rebuild.

To reproduce the stock baseline instead of the LuneOS one, put
`LUNEOS_KERNEL_FRAGMENT = "0"` in a conf file and pass it with `bitbake -R`.
Do that first whenever a KMI check fails: it separates "my delta broke it" from
"the tree or toolchain is wrong".

### Verified output, 13 Sep 2026

stock except the sizes and our deliberate command line.

## The stock firmware, and what it settled

`drive.zinwa.com` is a redirect to a public Google Drive folder
(`Q25-P26-Q27-res`). The path that matters:
`OS-Images / Q25 / MassProduction / With-GMS / OS-new-camera-0120-Q25-GMS.zip`
— 2.53 GiB, direct-downloadable with
`https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=14F9dbToL6euSiRKtBRJ_l6PGQYne0QNl&export=download&confirm=t`.
Take the **OS** archive, not the OTA one. It is a full SP Flash Tool package:
scatter, preloader, every firmware blob, `boot.img`, `vendor_boot.img`,
`super.img`, vbmeta, and — usefully — the partitions' `.prop` files loose in the
tree, so the identity questions are answerable without unpacking anything.

Local copy: `firmware/OS-new-camera-0120-Q25-GMS.zip`, unpacked to
`firmware/stock/`.

| Question | Answer | Where it came from |
|---|---|---|
| Codename | **`Q25`** | `q20_v12_factory/vendor.prop`: `ro.product.vendor.device=Q25` — the exact property `luneos-device-config` reads first. The adaptation directory was already right |
| Vendor API level | **31** (Android 12) | same file: `ro.vndk.version=31`, `ro.board.first_api_level=31` |
| Which GSI | the existing **halium_arm64 16.0** one | `halium-luneos-16.0-20260910-1-halium_arm64.tar.bz2` already carries `com.android.vndk.v31` (alongside v30/v32/v33/v34). No VNDK-snapshot work of the kind mindphone needed |
| init_boot? | **no** | stock `boot.img` has a 1,189,717-byte ramdisk; no `init_boot.img` ships. The scatter's `init_boot_a/b` are unused |
| os_version field | 12.0.0 / 2024-03 | `unpack_bootimg` on the stock boot.img. `ANDROID_BOOTIMG_OS_VERSION = "0x18000183"` reproduces it exactly |
| boot cmdline | **empty** | ditto. `bootopt=...` lives in vendor_boot's cmdline, which stays stock — so the padded LuneOS cmdline displaces nothing |
| Kernel image | `Image.gz` | stock kernel is gzip, 5.10.198-android12-9 |
| Clang | `r416183b` | the stock kernel's own version string, matching what the recipe pins |

### The stock kernel config, and what it means for the fragment

`CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC=y`, so the config came straight out of the boot image:
`firmware/stock-config-5.10.198.txt` (2,669 options).
`mer_verify_kernel_config` on it gives **23 errors / 54 warnings**
(`firmware/mer-check-stock-q25.txt`) — almost exactly bluejay's 23/59.

**21 of the 23 are already covered** by the LuneOS fragment plus the fork's
`droidian.config`. The two that are not are the two that should not be:

- `NET_L3_MASTER_DEV` — deliberately left off (adds `l3mdev_ops` to
  `struct net_device`, which every vendor wifi module touches). ofono does not
  need VRF.
- `DUMMY` — the checker wants `n` while its own stock run shows Android ships
  `y`. Known checker quirk; keep the Android value.

That is the same shape bluejay finished in: a handful of remaining errors, every
one accounted for.

The stock config also confirms the reasoning behind the kernel choice:

| Option | Stock | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| `SYSVIPC` | **not set** | the vendor modules were built without it, so enabling it plainly *would* move `task_struct` CRCs. The fork's ABI-padding patch is exactly why it is safe here and poison on bluejay |
| `PID_NS` | not set | ditto — and the `mali_kbase_mt6789` `find_get_pid` quirks exist because we turn it on |
| `MODVERSIONS` | `y` | the KMI check applies |
| `MODULE_SIG_FORCE` | not set | force-load is available as an escape hatch |
| `DEBUG_INFO_BTF` | not set | no pahole needed — the recipe already says so |
| `STATIC_USERMODEHELPER` | `y` | UMH is disabled in stock; the fragment unsets it so `request_module()` works |
| `VT`, `BT_HCIVHCI` | not set | both needed (bluebinder wants vhci); both come from `droidian.config` |
| `OVERLAY_FS` | **`y`** | the Tier 2 adaptation overlay path works here, unlike sargo's 4.9 kernel |
| `ANDROID_BINDERFS` | `y` | LuneOS's host-binderfs model works |
| `USB_CONFIGFS_RNDIS` + `ECM` | both `y` | both debug-network gadgets available |

### Getting the module set

`./extract-vendor-modules.sh firmware` reproduces it: 180 `.ko` out of the
vendor_boot ramdisk plus 184 out of `vendor_dlkm_a`, **344 unique** in
`firmware/vendor-modules/all/`. The two halves are different files and both
matter — `mali_kbase_mt6789.ko` and `mt6358-accdet.ko`, the two modules the
kernel quirks exist for, are in the `vendor_dlkm` half only.

This host has neither `lpunpack` nor `simg2img`, so `lpunpack.py` in this
directory is a minimal liblp reader (handles sparse input; `debugfs -R rdump`
then gets the files out of the ext4 without root).

## What is still needed

The kernel side is closed. What remains needs the device:

1. **Build the rootfs** (`MACHINE=halium-arm64 bitbake luneos-dev-image`) and the
   Halium 16 arm64 GSI tarball — the same one sargo runs; it already carries
   `com.android.vndk.v31`.
2. **Decide where `rootfs.img` and `android-rootfs.img` live** — flashed
   `userdata`, a microSD partition, or a `linux` partition carved out of
   `userdata` with `mtkclient`. See the install sketch.
3. **Flash and boot**, then work the debugging playbook stage by stage.
4. Re-check `mer_verify_kernel_config` against
   `tmp/deploy/images/q25/kernel-config` once, to confirm what remains is
   deliberate (expect `NET_L3_MASTER_DEV`, `DUMMY`, and now `SYSVIPC`).

Things that will want attention on first boot, in likely order:

- `mtk-load-modules.sh` in meta-android reads `/android/vendor/lib/modules`,
  which on a GKI device is an **absolute** symlink to `/vendor_dlkm/lib/modules`
  and so resolves on the *host*. It assumes the mindphone layout; expect it to
  need a vendor_dlkm-aware path here.
- The square panel: `deviceinfo_display_dpi` and `deviceinfo_device_pixel_ratio`
  are arithmetic, not tuning.
- The keyboard: one input node is the whole QWERTY, the toolbelt keys and the
  trackpad, so whatever decides "is there a hardware keyboard" sees an unusual
  device.

## The install kit

Re-cut **27 Sep 2026**: `/media/herrie/LuneOS/q25-staging/`, distributable as
`q25_20260927.zip` (1.22 GiB compressed, 4.15 GiB of payload, integrity verified).

| File | |
|---|---|
| `boot-q25-luneos.img` | 22.4 MB into the 64 MiB `boot` partition; carries the patched keyboard driver, and `kernel.release` = `5.10.198-android12-9-gfcab0aff02db` |
| `boot-q25-luneos-debug.img` | `enable_adb` variant |
| `userdata-luneos.img` | 4.2 GiB ext4 labelled `userdata`: `rootfs.img` (2.9 GiB halium-arm64) + `android-rootfs.img` (1.0 GiB, Halium 16 GSI `halium-luneos-16.0-20260910-1-halium_arm64`) side by side |
| `vbmeta.img` | Zinwa's own stock vbmeta |
| `install.sh`, `make-userdata.sh`, `README.md`, `SHA256SUMS` | |
| `userdata-src/` | the two images loose, for rebuilds (not zipped) |

`install.sh` gained two checks over the September version, both from the MP01:
a **lock-state check** (a locked MediaTek lk does not report itself locked; it
refuses individual critical partitions with "No support by lock control", which
reads like a problem with that partition) and a **partition-size report** (the
scatter nominally declares `userdata` as 3 GiB; the real one is ~228 GiB and the
image relies on the initramfs growing into it).

The GSI had to be regenerated: `bluejay-staging/android-rootfs.img` is gone with
the rest of the old staging dirs. The tarball in `DL_DIR` unpacks to a **raw**
ext4 `system.img`, so it is a rename rather than a `simg2img` — worth knowing,
because the recipe path does convert and the assumption is easy to carry over.

**Use the `halium-arm64` rootfs, not the `luneos-dev-image` built for
`MACHINE=q25`.** Both appear in `tmp/deploy/images` if someone builds the latter,
and only the former is correct: the whole point of the generic rootfs is that it
carries nothing device-specific, and `generic-rootfs-qa` exists to keep it so.

### The bug that assembling the kit exposed

`kbdscroll` **was not in the rootfs at all** — `/usr/sbin/kbdscroll: File not
found` — so every bit of the relative-pad work was dead on this device. Caught
only by checking the assembled image rather than trusting the build.

`packagegroup-luneos-extended` gated it on

```bitbake
RDEPENDS:${PN}:append = "${@bb.utils.contains_any('MACHINE_FEATURES', 'keyboard-touch trackpad', ...)}"
```

which is evaluated for the machine that **builds the rootfs**. That is
`halium-arm64`, whose `MACHINE_FEATURES` has neither flag; `trackpad` lives in
`q25.conf` and `keyboard-touch` in `athena.conf`, and neither of those machines
builds a rootfs. So the package could never reach either device.

This is the **same architectural gap as the kbdscroll profiles, one level up**:
anything gated on a device machine's `MACHINE_FEATURES` is invisible to the
shared rootfs. The fix matches how `70-q25.rules` and the
`luneos-device-config` adaptations already work — ship it on the generic image
and let the runtime decide:

```bitbake
RDEPENDS:${PN}:append:halium-arm64 = " ${KEYBOARD_TOUCH_RDEPENDS}"
RDEPENDS:${PN}:append:halium-arm   = " ${KEYBOARD_TOUCH_RDEPENDS}"
```

Safe because it is already how kbdscroll behaves: with no touch surface besides
the touchscreen it logs "nothing to do" and exits 0 deliberately, and its own
comment says the package is expected on machines that have none.

**Worth generalising: when a device builds only a boot image, every
`MACHINE_FEATURES`-gated package is a candidate for the same bug.** Grep
`contains_any('MACHINE_FEATURES'` in the packagegroups and ask, for each, whether
a q25/mp01/athena-style machine would ever see it.

Verified in the re-cut image: `kbdscroll` present (67,880 bytes, carrying the
relative code paths), `by-codename/{athena,q25}.conf` installed, the Q25 Tier 1
adaptation with all four MediaTek keys, and `70-q25.rules`.

## Install sketch (the manual sequence)

A/B, which gives the Droidian port's nicest property: **Android keeps slot A
and LuneOS takes slot B**, so the stock ROM stays bootable and switching is
`fastboot --set-active=other reboot`. Flashing slot B needs the stock firmware
flashed to slot B first (everything except `logo`, `super` and `boot_b`) or the
slot is in an unknown state — the Q25 wiki has the exact list.

```sh
fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta_b vbmeta.img
fastboot set_active b
fastboot flash boot_b   boot-q25-luneos.img
```

`rootfs.img` and `android-rootfs.img` then go into a filesystem the initramfs
can find. Three options, all of which the Q25 supports and none of which is
chosen yet:

- flashed `userdata` image (mindphone/sargo style),
- a microSD partition (Droidian's default, and the one that touches nothing),
- a dedicated `linux` partition carved out of `userdata` with `mtkclient` and
  one of the wiki's pre-built GPT blobs.

Anti-rollback: unknown on this device. Assume it exists, never flash older
firmware than what is on it.

## The boot blocker: vermagic (26 Sep 2026)

The port as it stood on 13 Sep **would not have booted**, and the reason is worth
stating in full because every individual check had passed.

`check-kmi.sh` said 344 of 344 stock modules load with 0 CRC mismatches, and
`mtk-load-modules.sh` escalates `modprobe` -> `--force-vermagic` -> `--force`, so
a vermagic that differed looked covered. Both true; both irrelevant to the
modules that decide whether the device comes up.

Those are loaded by the **initramfs**, not by that script. On this device the
storage and USB controllers are themselves vendor modules -
`ufs-mediatek-mod.ko`, `phy-mtk-ufs.ko`, `mtk-mmc.ko`, `musb_hdrc.ko`, all in the
stock `vendor_boot` ramdisk's `/lib/modules` - so `init.sh` must insmod them
before it can find userdata at all. The initramfs carries only **busybox**
insmod/modprobe, which has no `--force-vermagic`, and `CONFIG_MODULE_FORCE_LOAD`
is not set in the stock config either. Vermagic therefore has to genuinely match
or nothing loads, there is no userdata, and the phone is mute: no console (no
debug UART), no adb (the USB controller is one of the modules that did not load).

```
stock modules want:  5.10.198-android12-9-gfcab0aff02db SMP preempt mod_unload modversions aarch64
we were producing:   5.10.198-g2a873a3511ee             SMP preempt mod_unload modversions aarch64
now:                 5.10.198-android12-9-gfcab0aff02db   <- kernel.release, deployed as a build artefact
```

Everything after the release string already matched, because we build the
device's own config. The sublevel needed no rewriting either - the xelex tree is
genuinely 5.10.198, exactly what the stock kernel reports - so the fix is two
lines in `files/vermagic.cfg` (`CONFIG_LOCALVERSION`, `LOCALVERSION_AUTO` off)
plus an empty `.scmversion` written in `do_configure:prepend`, without which
`scripts/setlocalversion` appends a `+` and the match misses by one character.

Merged **unconditionally, including for the `LUNEOS_KERNEL_FRAGMENT="0"`
baseline**: it belongs to "reproduce the vendor's kernel", not to the LuneOS
delta, so the baseline must carry it or the baseline is not a baseline.

### Why not "build the vendor's modules instead" (kmi-crc-matching.md step -1)

That is the better answer on most devices and the wrong one here, for two
measured reasons:

1. **Nothing to buy.** The CRCs already match, 344 of 344. The binaries the
   device already has are fine; only the vermagic string blocked them.
2. **Actively risky on MT6789.** The MP01 embedded its 180 vendor modules
   (5.5 MB compressed), the boot image went 28 MB -> 31.6 MB, and lk then
   stopped loading it at all - no kmsg, no panic, nothing in expdb, on six
   consecutive images. The 64 MiB partition was never the constraint; the
   combined ramdisk the kernel must decompress is.

ThinLTO (`KERNEL_LTO_THIN = "1"`) is the other change worth having: it took the
kernel from 20.4 MB to **16.0 MB** and the boot image to ~22.6 MB, which is more
headroom under that ceiling as well as a much shorter build (the stock config's
full-LTO `vmlinux.o` link is ~20 minutes of a single core). KMI-neutral by
construction and re-verified 0/344.

## What else came from the MP01 (26 Sep 2026)

The MP01 is the same SoC, the same MediaTek `mgk` android12-5.10 kernel, and it
**boots to the LuneOS UI**. Read `device-mp01.md` alongside this. Taken from it:

| Change | Why |
|---|---|
| `cgroup_disable=net_prio` on the boot cmdline | Breaks a boot- *and* shutdown-time deadlock: `net_prio`'s `cgrp_css_online()` takes rtnl under cgroup_mutex, connmand holds rtnl in `ccmni_close()` waiting on an "events" work item, and every events kworker waits on cgroup_mutex in `cgroup_bpf_release()`. PID 1 then blocks in `proc_cgroup_show`. Nothing device-specific: `net_prio` is the only controller whose `css_online` takes rtnl, `ccmni` is MediaTek's shared cellular netdev, and LXC + connman are the same on every port |
| `deviceinfo_hybris_prefer_vndk="1"` | **Verified on this device, not assumed**: the Q25's own `/vendor/lib64/libnvram.so` (out of super.img) imports `android::base::Basename(const std::string&)`, which the Android 16 GSI's libbase no longer exports. Without it pulseaudio crashes on start |
| `deviceinfo_audio_sample_rate="48000"` | MediaTek's HAL runs its downlink paths at 48 kHz; at pulseaudio's default 44.1 kHz it resamples everything |
| `deviceinfo_bluebinder_ext_features_page_2_mask="0x0400000000000000"` | The MT6789 claims Synchronization Train support and then answers Read Synchronization Train Parameters with "Unknown HCI Command", aborting hci init - hci0 never comes up. Attributed to the chip, and this is the same chip with the same connac1x Bluetooth |
| `deviceinfo_force_hwc2="1"` | `ro.hardware.hwcomposer=mtk_common`, as on the MP01, where the compositor otherwise spun trying to become DRM master |

The same three userspace keys appear independently in the **radon** (MT6877)
adaptation, which is what makes them MediaTek-A12-vendor properties rather than
board ones.

Deliberately **not** copied, each with its reason recorded in the file that would
have carried it:

- `GKI_RAMDISK_COMPRESSION = "lz4-legacy"` - both of the Q25's stock ramdisks are
  **gzip** (checked with `file` on the unpacked stock `boot.img` and
  `vendor_boot.img`), which is what `initramfs-android-image` already produces.
  The MP01's are LZ4 and AOSP requires the compression to match across the
  bootloader's concatenation.
- `initcall_debug=0 loglevel=4` - these undo an MP01 vendor_boot cmdline that
  turns both on. The Q25's is `bootopt=64S3,32N2,64N2 buildvariant=user` and
  turns on neither.
- `deviceinfo_battery_critical_percent="0"` - different charging hardware
  entirely (mt6358_battery + hodafone_battery, upm6922/upm6722, mt6375 PD). If
  the phone powers off within a minute on a charger, check
  `/sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity` first - that is the MP01's symptom.
- `deviceinfo_backlight_outdoor_scale` (E Ink only) and
  `deviceinfo_compositor_geometry` (the MP01's panel is mounted rotated; the
  Q25's is square).

## Module audit: what our tree can and cannot build (26 Sep 2026)

Prompted by a good question - whether we actually have source for the keyboard
driver, given the `.o_shipped` objects sitting next to it in the LineageOS repo.

**We do.** kbuild's `%.o: %.c` rule wins wherever the `.c` exists, and
`.bbqX0kbd_main.o.cmd` in the build tree is a full 133 KB clang invocation, not a
`cp`. Our `bbqX0kbd.ko` carries the same 43 text symbols as the stock binary -
including Zinwa's own `hodafone_q20_*`, `q20_switch_key_mouse_*`,
`q20_spec_power_flag_*` and `firmware_upgrade_*` - differing only by ThinLTO's
`$<hash>` CFI suffixes on static functions. The `.o_shipped` files are ignored
dead weight.

Systematically, our build produces **333 of the device's 344 stock modules**. The
11 it does not:

| Missing | What it is | Source | Matters? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `met.ko` + 9 × `met_*_api.ko` | MediaTek Extensive Tracing (profiling) | **absent from the tree** | No - debug tooling |
| `fpsgo.ko` | an older FPS governor; we build `mtk_fpsgo.ko` from `performance/fpsgo_v3/` | v3 only | No - perf tuning |

None of them blocks anything: the device keeps all 344 stock modules and they now
load.

### A naming bug worth fixing before it bites

`mali_mgm_mt6789.ko` and `mali_prot_alloc_mt6789.ko` were in that missing list
until 26 Sep, and the reason was not missing source. MediaTek's Mali tree sets

```make
MTK_PLATFORM_VERSION := $(CONFIG_MTK_PLATFORM:"%"=%)      # midgard/Makefile:21
```

without exporting it, and the two **sibling** directories name their modules from
it:

```make
obj-m += mali_mgm_$(MTK_PLATFORM_VERSION).o
obj-m += mali_prot_alloc_$(MTK_PLATFORM_VERSION).o
```

kbuild descends into them with the variable unset, so we produced `mali_mgm_.ko`
and `mali_prot_alloc_.ko`. `mali_kbase` escapes it because
`drivers/gpu/mediatek/Makefile` *exports* `MTK_PLATFORM`, which is what names
that one. Android's build passes the variable in the environment, which is why
the vendor never hit it.

Harmless while we ship no modules of our own, but it is exactly the silent
failure kmi-crc-matching.md warns about under *"DO match the layout exactly"*:
the vendor's `modules.load` and `modules.dep` address modules by name, so a
future module override would quietly skip these two and load the vendor's
binaries against our kernel. Fixed with `MTK_PLATFORM_VERSION=mt6789` on the
recipe's make line; overlap went 331 -> 333 and the KMI check stayed at 0/344.

## The keyboard: what actually reaches Qt

Established 26 Sep by reading the driver, and it is a real gap rather than a
tuning question.

The Q20 keyboard hardware reports **uppercase ASCII scancodes**; the driver
resolves them and reports both `EV_MSC/MSC_SCAN` (the raw scancode) and an
`EV_KEY` keycode. **Android reads the scancode** through
`Q25_keyboard.kl`/`.kcm`, which is why punctuation works there. **Qt's
evdevkeyboard plugin reads only `EV_KEY`**, and the driver's two layer maps cover
only:

- `bbqX0kbd_get_num_lock_keycode()` - digits: W->1, E->2, R->3, S->4, D->5,
  F->6, Z->7, X->8, C->9, `$`->0. And it is gated on a **latched num-lock**
  (Alt then RightShift), not on Alt being held.
- `bbqX0kbd_get_altgr_keycode()` - navigation and volume only: PageUp/PageDown,
  arrows, Home, Menu, VolUp/VolDown, Mute, Delete.

Every symbol in the Q20 layout - `# ( ) _ - + @ * / : ; ' " ? ! , . \ ^ = { } [ ]
< > &` - falls through `default: returnValue = keycode`, so Qt sees the bare
letter keycode with Alt or Sym reported as an ordinary modifier. **On LuneOS as
it stands the keyboard types letters, digits, arrows and Enter/Space/Backspace,
and no punctuation at all.**

There is no per-device keymap file to fix it with, which is worth writing down
because it is the obvious first assumption:

- `generate_qmap` (qt-features-webos) takes **only an output path** and emits a
  fixed built-in table (Qt's default plus `webos_keymap`). There is no input
  keymap, so a `.qmap` cannot be device-specific without patching that shared
  recipe - which would change Alt+letter behaviour on every other device.
- `kbdscroll`'s `profiles/<machine>.conf` is the right *shape* of answer but the
  wrong tool: it reads **absolute** touch surfaces and says so explicitly - "an
  optical pad that reports REL_X/REL_Y is already a pointer to the compositor
  and is not what this reads". The Q25's trackpad is relative.
- The `.kl`/`.kcm` in the LineageOS device tree are Android's, read via
  `MSC_SCAN`, which Qt never looks at.

Which also means **`trackpad` in q25.conf's MACHINE_FEATURES is questionable**:
it gates `KEYBOARD_TOUCH_RDEPENDS` and so installs kbdscroll, which by its own
documentation cannot read this pad.

### Closed: the symbol layers are resolved in the driver (26 Sep 2026)

`meta-zinwa/recipes-kernel/linux/files/0001-bbqX0kbd-Q20-symbol-layers.patch`
maps both layers to the keycode and shift state a US layout needs, taken from the
diagram in `bbq20kbd_pmod_codes.h` (character printed *above* a key = Alt,
*below* = Sym). `q20_layers=0` as a module parameter restores stock behaviour
without a rebuild.

Three things it has to get right, each of which would fail silently:

- **Declare the new keycodes.** `KEY_MINUS`, `KEY_SLASH`, `KEY_SEMICOLON`,
  `KEY_APOSTROPHE`, `KEY_COMMA`, `KEY_DOT`, `KEY_BACKSLASH`, `KEY_LEFTBRACE`,
  `KEY_RIGHTBRACE` are not in the base table, and the input core **drops** an
  event for a key the device never set in `input->keybit`. The probe now sets
  them from the two tables.
- **Remember what was emitted, per scancode.** Releasing Alt before the key
  would otherwise report a release for a keycode never pressed and leave the
  symbol held down for ever.
- **Do not fight a physical shift.** The synthetic `KEY_LEFTSHIFT` is injected
  only when neither physical shift is down.

Alt and Sym are no longer reported to userspace at all: on this keyboard they are
layer selectors printed on the keys, not PC modifiers, and reporting them makes
the toolkit see `Alt+Shift+3` rather than `#`.

**The patch alone would have been dead code**, and this is the part worth
remembering. `bbqX0kbd.ko` is a *module*, in the stock `vendor_boot` ramdisk's
`modules.load` (line 129 of 160), and the Q25 ships none of its own modules - so
the device would have loaded the vendor's binary and never seen the patch. The
fix is the MP01's arrangement for its patched `mediatek-drm.ko`:

- the recipe's `do_install` puts the stripped module in the machine initramfs,
- `q25.conf` sets `ANDROID_EXTRA_INITRAMFS_IMAGE_INSTALL = "linux-zinwa-q25"`,
- `init.sh`'s `stage_our_kernel_modules()` copies `/usr/lib/modules/*.ko` over the
  vendor's `/lib/modules/` before anything is modprobed - necessary because
  usrmerge packages ours at `/usr/lib/modules` while the vendor ramdisk creates a
  real `/lib/modules`, and cpio only substitutes at an identical path,
- `load_kernel_modules()` then loads in the vendor's own `modules.load` order, so
  the dependency order stays theirs and only the binary is ours.

It logs `initrd: installed 1 of our own kernel modules over the vendor's` to
kmsg, which is the thing to grep for on first boot.

One 66 KB module, not the 344-module wholesale copy: the boot image is 22.4 MB,
against the ~28 MB at which the MP01 measured lk refusing to load one at all.

Verified: patch applies cleanly, driver compiles with no warnings, the new
`q20_alt_layer`/`q20_sym_layer`/`q20_held_*` symbols are in the built module, it
is present in the initramfs at `/usr/lib/modules/bbqX0kbd.ko`, and the KMI check
is still 344 of 344.

**Untested on hardware.** The layout transcription, whether suppressing Alt/Sym
breaks any shortcut worth having, and whether the shift injection reads correctly
through Qt all want checking on the device.

### Scrolling: kbdscroll now reads a relative pad (26 Sep 2026)

The keyboard types; the *pad* is what scrolls, and it did nothing. Two facts
decide the design:

- **The LuneOS shell scrolls under a finger, not a cursor.** kbdscroll exists
  precisely because nothing in a Wayland stack does anything useful with a
  secondary surface, and it injects a synthetic touch contact so "every toolkit
  (Mojo, Enyo, QML, Chromium) scrolls - and flings - exactly as it would under a
  real finger". Moving a pointer around buys almost nothing here.
- **The Q25's pad is relative.** The driver advertises `EV_REL` `REL_X`/`REL_Y`
  and nothing else - signed int8 deltas - so there is no coordinate space, no
  touch-down and no touch-up. kbdscroll excluded relative pads by design, on the
  grounds that "the compositor already turns that into a pointer… a device that
  has one does not need this". True on a desktop, false on a touch-first shell,
  and the Q25 is the device that falls through the gap.

So kbdscroll now reads relative pads, with the gesture boundaries synthesised:
first movement after stillness is the contact coming down, `rel-lift-ms` (120 ms)
of stillness is it lifting. The deltas accumulate into a virtual surface
(`rel-width`/`rel-height`, defaulting to the screen's size so one pad unit is one
screen pixel at scale 1.0), and everything downstream - slop, axis locking,
scale, the fling, the cursor modifier, typing-cancels-the-gesture - is the same
code the absolute path uses. The lift feeds one synthetic `SYN_REPORT` through
the same loop rather than duplicating the end-of-stroke handling, so there is
exactly one code path.

It deliberately does **not** grab the device: on the Q25 the pad and the whole
QWERTY are one input node (`Q25_keyboard`), so a grab would swallow typing. If a
cursor turns out to move and fight the injected finger, that belongs in the
compositor's input configuration, not here.

`profiles/q25.conf` is the config file. Two entries in it are judgements rather
than measurements and are the first things to check on hardware:

- `cursor-modifier = rightalt`, not the default Alt. On this keyboard **Alt is
  the symbol layer** - Alt+Q is `#` - so leaving the modifier on Alt would make
  every punctuation mark move the text cursor instead. Sym already carries the
  printed arrow keys, which is the same idea.
- `arrows = uinput`. A Classic layout has no dedicated arrow keys, so a device of
  our own is the only way to send them.

### The profile mechanism had to change too

kbdscroll installed `profiles/${MACHINE}.conf` at build time. That cannot work
for this device, or for mp01, or for any other Halium target: they build **no
rootfs of their own** and run the generic `halium-arm64` one, where `${MACHINE}`
is `halium-arm64` and a `q25.conf` would simply never be installed.

So profiles now ship together and are selected at runtime by codename, from
`LUNEOS_DEVICE_CODENAME` in `/run/luneos-device/device.env` - the same
arrangement `luneos-device-config` uses for its Tier 1 adaptations, for the same
reason. Codenames are not reliably lowercase (`Q25`, `MP01`) while profiles are
named after the machine, so the exact spelling is tried first and then lowercase.

A machine that *does* build its own rootfs keeps its build-time drop-in as well,
so athena's tuning does not become conditional on codename derivation working.
Verified: the generic rootfs gets `by-codename/{athena,q25}.conf`, athena gets
those **plus** its original `10-athena.conf`.

Verified: compiles clean under `-Wall -Wextra` and in the cross environment for
both machines, the new options appear in `--help`, and `--list` degrades
gracefully. **Not run against hardware** - there is no `/dev/uinput` or
`/dev/input` access on the build host, so the state machine has been reasoned and
compiled but never exercised. The test on the device is
`kbdscroll --list` (is `Q25_keyboard` chosen as the pad, and reported as
`relative`?) then `kbdscroll --debug` while sliding: expect
`relative contact down`, then `touch at x,y`, then
`relative contact up: N ms still`.

### What is still worth doing

`keyd` stays the deferred alternative, and is still worth doing later for what
the driver route cannot give: the three layout variants (qwerty/qwertz/azerty)
switchable without a rebuild, latched/one-shot modifiers, remapping the toolbelt
keys to Ctrl/Alt when held as Droidian does, and a user-editable config. What the
driver route gives that keyd cannot: it works in the initramfs and a TTY, needs
no daemon or evdev grab, and keeps one source of truth for the layout.

### The two routes, as assessed before choosing

1. **Patch the driver** - extend the two lookup functions to cover the symbols,
   synthesise `KEY_LEFTSHIFT` around the shifted ones, make Alt work held rather
   than latched, and stop reporting Alt/Sym as modifiers so Qt does not see
   `Alt+Shift+3`. Self-contained in our own kernel, and now known to be viable
   since the source is complete.
2. **Port `keyd`** and ship the Droidian port's `q25-qwerty`/`qwertz`/`azerty`
   configs, which are already tested on this exact hardware. A new recipe, but it
   sits between evdev and everything, so Qt, maliit and Waydroid all benefit, and
   the layout becomes a user-editable file per layout.

## How much of mindphone transfers (both are MediaTek)

Short answer: the *method* transfers, almost none of the *specifics* do. MT6739
and MT6789 are two generations and a different connectivity family apart, and
mindphone is pre-GKI while the Q25 is GKI-shaped.

| | mindphone (MT6739) | q25 (MT6789) |
|---|---|---|
| Android / kernel | 11 / 4.14, 32-bit | 12 / 5.10 mgk, arm64 |
| Partitions | non-dynamic, no vendor_boot | A/B, dynamic `super`, `vendor_dlkm` |
| Connectivity family | WMT (`wmt_drv`, `wlan_drv_gen2`, `bt_drv`, `gps_drv`) | connac1x (`wmt_drv`, `wmt_chrdev_wifi`, `wlan_drv_gen4m_6789`, `bt_drv_connac1x`, `connfem`) |
| Where the modules live | `/vendor/lib/modules` directly | `/vendor/lib/modules` → **absolute symlink** to `/vendor_dlkm/lib/modules` |
| How they are declared | vendor's `modules.load` | vendor's **init rc** `insmod` lines, property-templated |
| Stock module CRCs vs ours | mismatch → `--force` required | **match** → only vermagic differs |

### What transfers unchanged

- The whole `mtk-connectivity` idea: mirror the vendor's `.ko` into
  `/lib/modules`, `depmod`, load them host-side, then poke `/dev/wmtWifi` and
  fix `/dev/stpbt` ownership for the container's BT HAL.
- `mtk-bt-address.sh` — the BT MAC is the first six bytes of
  `/mnt/vendor/nvdata/APCFG/APRDEB/BT_Addr` on both. The Q25's `fstab.mt6789`
  does mount `/mnt/vendor/nvdata`, so the path is right.
- The `/data/nvram` symlink for `wmt_drv`'s kernel-space nvram open.
- The `fstab.<ro.hardware>`-over-`fstab.enableswap` selection fix that mindphone
  forced — already generic, and the Q25 needs it for the same MTK NV partitions.

### The `/vendor_dlkm` symlink is a non-issue (I flagged it wrongly at first)

`/vendor/lib/modules` is an absolute symlink to `/vendor_dlkm/lib/modules`, so
reading it through `/android/vendor/...` resolves against the **host** root.
That is fine, because `mount-android.sh` deliberately mounts `vendor_dlkm` at
host `/vendor_dlkm` — it cannot go under `$ANDROID_ROOT`, since LXC drops
anything mounted on the container rootfs. Checked on the real images:
`/vendor_dlkm/etc/build.prop` exists, so `try_mount_validated` accepts the
mount, and `/vendor_dlkm/lib/modules/modules.load` is there.

### What did NOT transfer, and had to be fixed

Two real bugs, both found by reading the Q25's own vendor partition:

1. **`mtk-load-modules.sh` picked the wrong modules.** It drove off the
   vendor's `modules.load`, which on MT6789 contains only `connadp.ko` and
   `c2k_usb_f_via_gps.ko` of the connectivity family — the real drivers are
   `insmod`ed by the vendor's init rc behind a two-stage gate:

   | trigger | modules |
   |---|---|
   | `on boot` | `wmt_drv.ko`, `connfem.ko` |
   | `on property:vendor.connsys.driver.ready=yes` | `${ro.vendor.wlan.chrdev}`, `wlan_drv_${ro.vendor.wlan.gen}`, `bt_drv_${ro.vendor.bt.platform}`, `${ro.vendor.gps.chrdev}`, `gps_pwr`, `fmradio_drv_${ro.vendor.fm.platform}` |

   That property is set by the container's own connsys daemon after it patches
   the CONSYS firmware — the same class of never-fires gate as the
   `wait_for_prop` problem `start-android-hals.sh` solves. The script now
   **derives** the ordered list from the rc files and expands the property
   templates off the mounted vendor partition, which keeps it device-agnostic.
   Verified offline against the Q25's own rc files and `build.prop`:

   ```
   connfem  wmt_drv  bt_drv_connac1x  fmradio_drv_mt6631_6635
   gps_drv_stp  gps_pwr  wmt_chrdev_wifi  wlan_drv_gen4m_6789
   ```

   with `wmt_drv` correctly ahead of the Wi-Fi pair. The `modules.load` path is
   kept as a fallback for the WMT era.

2. **The Bluetooth unit never ran.** `mtk-connectivity-bt.service` gated on
   `ConditionPathExists=|…/bt_drv.ko` or `…/conninfra.ko`; the Q25 has
   `bt_drv_connac1x.ko` and **no** `conninfra.ko` at all, so neither matched and
   systemd skipped the unit silently. Now `ConditionPathExistsGlob` with
   `bt_drv*.ko` / `conninfra*.ko`.

Also changed: the loader tries plain `modprobe`, then `--force-vermagic`, then
`--force`. On a KMI-preserving port only the vermagic string differs — ours is
`5.10.198-g2a873a3511ee` against stock's `5.10.198-android12-9-gfcab0aff02db`,
with `SMP preempt mod_unload modversions aarch64` identical — so
`--force-modversions` is not wanted, and blanket `--force` would hide a real CRC
regression. The fallback chain keeps mindphone working, where the CRCs genuinely
do disagree.

### Still mindphone-only, and worth revisiting on hardware

- **`mtk-ril-watchdog`** (in `meta-greentouch`, so mindphone-only today).
  The Q25's `mtkrild.rc` declares `vendor.ril-daemon-mtk` with the *identical*
  `oneshot` + `disabled` pair that means init will not respawn it, and it runs
  the same `mtkfusionrild`. If telephony dies once and stays dead, this is the
  fix — but it needs moving to `meta-android` (the Q25 builds no rootfs of its
  own) and it should not be moved blind.
- **`bluebinder`'s `mt6739-le-commands.conf`.** That patches an MT6739
  controller that under-reports its LE supported-commands bitmap. The Q25 is
  connac1x, a different controller; do not copy it. If LE discovery finds
  nothing while classic inquiry works, that file is the known *shape* of the
  fix, with a bitmap derived for this chip.

## Known hazards, inherited from the Droidian port

Worth reading before concluding any of these is a LuneOS bug:

- **The 20-character cmdline.** MediaTek's G99 lk drops the first 20 characters
  of the boot image command line. `ANDROID_BOOTIMG_CMDLINE` pads with `?`
  accordingly. Anything LuneOS really needs goes in `CONFIG_CMDLINE` instead,
  which is where the cgroup-v1 pair lives.
- `/vendor/lib/modules` on a GKI device is an **absolute** symlink to
  `/vendor_dlkm/lib/modules`, which resolves on the *host* when LuneOS reads it
  through `/android/vendor/...`. `mtk-load-modules.sh` in meta-android assumes
  the mindphone layout; expect it to need a vendor_dlkm-aware path here.
- Backlight IC varies between units: `ocp2131` on early ones, `rt4831a` on
  final. `ocp2131_drv.ko` is in the shipped module list.
- Headset: needs replugging if present at boot; mic is always routed from the
  jack. Both are kernel-workaround artefacts on Droidian.
- Hotspot needs `echo A > /dev/wmtWifi` rather than the UI toggle.
- Signal strength is under-reported by the modem stack.
